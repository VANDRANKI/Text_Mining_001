This work mainly reviews the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide, the factors affecting the CMP rate and the improvement methods.  In the aspect of CMP cleaning, the introduction of additives, water cleaning, chemical cleaning and other cleaning methods are summarized.  On this basis, some suggestions were proposed to provide valuable references for the STI CMP and post cleaning based on cerium oxide abrasive.  1. Introduction In advanced integrated circuit manufacturing processes, dielectric materials are commonly used for electrolyte insulation, surface passiv - ation, diffusion masking [1], and reducing RC delay [2].  The dielectric materials used mainly include silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, high k/low k dielectrics, etc.  Silicon dioxide is widely used in the field of integrated circuit manufacturing due to its low cost, easy preparation, excellent dielectric properties, and good process compatibility.",
    "It is usually used as an insulation layer, dielectric isolation, protective layer, passivation layer, gate oxide layer, or diffusion mask layer.  of sensing area.  The 3D stacking technology using the etching process has been widely adopted due to its advantages of high density, good performance and low cost.  Fig.  1 shows (a) pipe-shaped bit-cost-scalable (P-BiCS) and (b) terabit-cell-array transistor (TCAT) for 3D NAND, respectively.  Typically, silicon nitride is used as a charge trapping layer (CTL) to store charges, while silicon oxide or alumina is used as a barrier oxide (BOX) layer [3].  As can be seen from the NAND structure, isolation processes are essential.  The traditional local oxida - tion of silicon (LOCOS) process is a commonly used isolation technology in the manufacturing of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS).",
    "However, the conventional LOCOS process is greatly limited due to the fact that oxygen diffused into silicon dioxide will come into contact with the silicon on the side, leading to field oxygen erosion in the direction of the active area and causing the \"beak effect\" [4].  to achieve isolation of the active area, as shown in Fig.  2 [5].  Because STI technology can achieve smaller isolation spacing and superior latch protection, it is widely used in technology nodes of 0. 25 \u00b5m and below.  In the STI process, the flattening of oxides is a particularly important part, as shown in Fig.  2(d).  At this point, the silicon nitride on the silicon surface acts as a barrier layer to prevent damage to important surfaces during planarization and epitaxial growth processes.  When performing oxide flattening, it is necessary to retain silicon nitride while removing the silica.  Therefore, the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process of STI should not only consider the surface morphology and polishing Fig.  1. Y-Z cross view of CT-based NAND [3].  Fig.  2. A schematic representation of the STI Process.",

As the feature size of semiconductor technology continues to decrease, STI technology requires abrasives for CMP (as shown in Fig.  2d) process to have high selectivity and low defect levels while guaranteeing high polishing rates.  In order to meet the process requirements, the removal rate selection ratio of silica and silicon nitride needs to be 30:1.  In the absence of any additives, the removal rate se- lection ratio of silica and silicon nitride polished with the slurry con- taining cerium oxide, alumina, silica and silicon carbide abrasives was compared [6].  At the same speed and pressure, the slurry containing cerium oxide abrasive can achieve the highest removal rate of silica, and the highest selection ratio of silica and silicon nitride.  Therefore, for the STI process, cerium oxide abrasive becomes a preferred choice for the oxide planarization.  Cerium oxide is a fluorite oxide with a face-centered cubic crystal structure, as shown in Fig.",
    "3 [7], with each cerium atom surrounded by eight oxygen atoms.  between the two valence states (Ce3\u0087and Ce4\u0087), oxygen vacancies are formed in the lattice, that is, the appearance of Ce3\u0087must be accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies, which contributes to the formation of CeO 2 and CeO 2\u0000x.  This property also endows cerium oxide nanoparticles with redox ability, which can be used as catalysts for oxidation or reduction reaction.  The strength of redox capacity is closely related to the concentration of oxygen va- cancies, which can be reflected by the determination of Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087in cerium oxide, or quantified by oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [8], which is the number of moles of oxygen released per gram of the initial ma- terial.  The redox capacity of cerium oxide can be controlled by changing its surface properties, particle size, particle shape, and preparation process.  Due to its redox properties, cerium oxide can be used in catalysts [9], fuel cell electrolytes [10], automobile exhaust cleaning agents [11], biomedicine [12], chemical mechanical polishing [13] and other fields.",
    "With the decreasing of feature size in integrated circuits, the re- quirements for the removal rate of oxide layer and surface quality are also increasing.  obtain a wafer surface with fewer defects and lower roughness under the premise of high polishing rate and selectivity is a problem worth exploring.  In addition, the removal of residue cerium oxide particles after polishing is also the focus of current research.  Because residual particle will lead to uneven morphology of the micro areas on the wafer surface, affecting lithography accuracy, and even chip failure.  How to remove cerium oxide particles without damaging the wafer surface is also one of the key issues that need to be paid attention to.  In this article, the research progress of cerium oxide in the field of CMP was reviewed.",
    "Firstly, the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide is introduced, with the formation of Ce-O-Si bonds being the main role.  dishing, surface uniformity after polishing.  Finally, the current cleaning methods for dielectric materials polished with cerium oxide were introduced, mainly including acid cleaning solution and alkaline cleaning solution, as well as their improvement methods.  This will provide reference for improving the performance of dielectric CMP and post-polishing cleaning based on cerium oxide abrasive in IC manufacturing processes.  2. Correlation mechanism between CeO 2 abrasive and SiO2 dielectric layer The particle size, Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087value and surface properties of ceria abrasives will affect polishing performance such as the polishing rate, surface morphology, and selectivity.  Therefore, the research progress in these aspects is summarized and suggestions for improving polishing performance are proposed.  CMP is a particularly important part of integrated circuit manufacturing process.  CMP treatment of wafer surface can greatly improve the flatness of wafer, which will affect the subsequent process.  The process of polishing the fused silica surface with abrasives and the scratches caused by abrasives are shown in Fig.",
    "4[14] .  at a constant speed, while the polishing slurry drops on the polishing pad at a certain speed.  In this process, the abrasive will leave certain scratches on the fused silica, which should be avoided as much as possible during the polishing process.  The shape and hardness of the abrasive play a decisive role in the removal effect and scratch state of the material.  Therefore, it is very important to find an appropriate abrasive shape to improve the polish - ing performance.  The hardness of cerium oxide is 5. 5, which is much lower than that of diamond, alumina, silicon dioxide, etc.  From the mechanical point of view, it is not suitable for polishing silicon dioxide, but from the chemical perspective, it will catalyze the hydration of the surface of silicon dioxide, which is very dependent on water.  The interaction be- tween the SiO2 surface and water is one of the main steps of polishing process.  Hydration steps are shown in Eqs.",

Cerium oxide has chemical teeth, which can accelerate the breaking of chemical bonds on the surface of silicon dioxide and the removal rate of reaction products is greater than the formation rate of surface compound.  So, cerium oxide is a good abrasive for silica CMP.  The following is a detailed introduction to the principle of removing silica with cerium oxide.  The adsorption of cerium oxide on the surface of silicon oxide in- volves multiple aspects, and research methods mainly include immer - sion and polishing.  Immersion refers to soaking a silica sample in cerium oxide slurry, so that the surface of the sample is contaminated with cerium oxide.  Compared with immersion, polishing also involves pres- sure and rotation friction related to the physical properties of the pol- ishing pad.  Therefore, for these two methods, the adsorption degree of cerium oxide on the surface of samples is different, and it is expected that the samples obtained through polishing will adsorb more cerium oxide.",
    "Han K-M et al.  pH; but for polishing, the samples adsorbed more particles when pH was high.  And in general, the polishing process produces more particle adsorption than the soaking process.  Therefore, in order to study the action mechanism of cerium oxide in the polishing process more accurately, the following discussion mainly focuses on the contamination of samples by polishing.  Cerium oxide is adsorbed on silica surface by electrostatic and chemical forces.  The pH value at the Zeta potential of 0 is called the isoelectric point (IEP).  Within the pH range of 3\u201311, the Zeta potential measurements of cerium oxide and TEOS (Tetraethyl orthosilicate) are shown in Fig.  5[16] : The IEP of cerium oxide is between 7 and 8.  The Zeta potential is positive when the pH is lower than the IEP, while it is negative when the pH is greater than the IEP.  The Zeta potential of TEOS is always negative and becomes more negative as the pH increases in the range of pH 3\u201311.  Therefore, when the pH is lower than the IEP of cerium oxide, i.",
    "e.  is a strong electrostatic repulsion between the two.  In polishing process, there are more particles adsorbed on the surface of samples when the pH value is high, indicating that the effect of electrostatic repulsion can be ignored, and chemisorption may be the main reason.  Under different pH conditions, the existence states of cerium oxide and silicon oxide are different.  At lower pH, cerium oxide exists in the form of Ce-OH2\u0087, while silicon oxide exists in the form of Si-OH2\u0087.  At higher pH, cerium oxide exists in the form of Ce-OH or Ce- O-, while the silicon oxide exists in the form of Si-OH or Si-O- [17].  The acid-base equilibrium formula of the oxides of cerium oxide [15] and silicon oxide [18] under different acid-base conditions is as follows, where pHpzc represents the pH of the solution at the zero charge point of cerium oxide: Ce\u0000OH\u0087 2\u2194Ce\u0000OH\u0087H\u0087CpHDpH pzc (3) Ce\u0000OH\u2194Ce\u0000O\u0000\u0087H\u0087CpHFpH pzc (4) Si\u0000OH\u0087 2\u0087H2O\u2194Si\u0000OH\u0087H3O\u0087CpKa1\u00880B2 (5) Si\u0000OH\u0087H2O\u2194Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087H3O\u0087CpKa2\u00885B4 (6) According to the theory proposed by Cook L M et al.",
    "[15], in the polishing process, cerium compounds react with silicon compounds as follows: Ce\u0000OH\u0087Si\u0000O\u0000\u2194Ce\u0000O\u0000Si\u0087OH\u0000(7) It can be seen that the formation of Ce-O-Si bonds is the main reason for chemisorption. J et al.[19] found that the degree of non-specific adsorption of silicic acid and metal oxides is greater. The formation and deprotonation of silicic acid are shown in Formula (8): SiO 2\u00872H2O\u2194Si OH\u00864\u2194SiO OH\u0086\u0000 3\u0087H\u0087(8) Under different pH conditions, different cerium compounds react with silicon compound SiO(OH) 3-, as shown in formula (9) - (11)[20]: \u0000Ce\u0000OH\u0087 2\u0087SiO OH\u0086\u0000 3\u2194\u0000Ce\u0000O\u0000SiO OH\u0086\u0000 2\u0087H3O\u0087CpHDpH pzc (9) Fig. 4.Schematic illustration of CMP process and abrasive grains scratching [14].

According to the existence forms of cerium oxide and silicon oxide at different pH values mentioned above, the Ce-O-Si bond formed by the two is weaker under acidic conditions, but stronger under alkaline conditions due to the absence of excessive acidic ions.  Therefore, under alkaline conditions, more cerium oxide particles will be adsorbed on the surface of silicon oxide.  In addition, in order to obtain a smoother silicon oxide surface, the cleaning process after CMP is also particularly important.  According to the bonding method shown in Fig.  6, the fracture of Ce-O/Si-O bonds can also be used as a breakthrough point for post CMP cleaning.  3. Effect of CeO 2 Abrasive on the performance of dielectric CMP 3. 1.",
    "Effect of cerium oxide particle size Generally, the preparation methods of cerium oxide include calci- nation [21], sol-gel method [22], precipitation method [23], hydro - thermal method [24], Solvothermal method [25], hydroxide mediated method [26], etc.  method is the most commonly used.  In the production of cerium oxide, different calcination temperatures will lead to different particle sizes of cerium oxide.  Fig.  7 [13] shows the average particle size, Ce3\u0087concentration, and corre - sponding polishing removal rate of silicon dioxide for cerium oxide calcined at different temperatures.  It can be seen that the particle size of cerium oxide abrasive increases with the increase of calcination tem- perature, and the fastest increase occurs at 600\u2013800\u2103.  At the same time, the material removal rate (MRR) showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, with a boundary point of approximately 1000 \u2103 between the increase and decrease.  It is speculated that the increase in MRR is due to the increase of Ce3\u0087concentration caused by the increase in cerium oxide particle size.",
    "The reason why the polishing rate did not increase monotonically may be attributed to the decreasing of Ce3\u0087 concentration at too high temperature.  and surface roughness in the polishing process, both of which are the key factors in evaluating the polishing performance.  Therefore, it is of great significance to study the influence of abrasive particle size on polishing performance.  Sampurno Y et al. [27] found through experiments that the coefficient of friction (COF) and MRR of plasma-enhanced tetraethy - lorthosilicate (PETEOS) chips are directly related to the median particle size of cerium oxide abrasives.  Generally speaking, the larger the par- ticle size of abrasive, the higher the COF value.  Usually, the higher the COF, the larger the corresponding MRR.  Because high COF means high shear force, enabling the oxide film to be removed quickly.  However, the optimal particle size was not indicated, and the roughness of polished surface was not taken into consideration.  In the actual production, it is unrealistic to blindly pursue the polishing rate.  The increase in particle size will lead to the increase of surface roughness.",
    "Therefore, it is sug- gested to determine the optimal particle size based on the surface state of the wafer.  et al.  [28] synthesized cerium oxide particles with good uniformity using the flux method.  The particle size was controlled by changing the calcination conditions, and the main particle sizes were 88, 166, 295 and 417nm, respectively.  Using cerium oxide abrasives with different particle sizes to polish silicon oxide and silicon nitride, the MRR shows varying degrees of increase with the increase of abrasive size, so the selection ratio changes.  The MRR of silica is about 3989 \u00c5/min, while that of silicon nitride is about 127\u00c5/min using cerium oxide abrasive with a particle size of 295nm.  In this case, the maximum selection ratio is 32:1.  However, the within-wafer nonuni - formity (WIWNU) increases with the increase of the abrasive particle size.  This is because as the abrasive particle size increases, the distri - bution of abrasive particle size in the slurry becomes wider.",
    "Different particle sizes of abrasives have different fluidity on the wafer, so a wider particle size distribution will result in different uniformity between the center and edge of the wafer.  14. 6%.  Considering MRR, removal rate selection ratio and WIWNU, 295nm is a good choice.  This provides a reference for the particle size selection of cerium oxide abrasives in practical production.  Xu G et al.  [14] synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles with control - lable diameter and uniform shape by hydrothermal method.  The particle size, corresponding roughness and MRR are shown in Table 1.  It can be seen that within a certain particle size range, the surface roughness and MRR are negatively correlated with the abrasive particle size, which is inconsistent with the previous conclusions, and it is speculated that the synthesis method of cerium oxide is different.",
    "Although the MRR of silicon oxide polished with cerium oxide synthesized by this method is lower than that using commercial cerium oxide abrasives, the surface roughness of the wafer is 45% lower than that samples polished with commercial cerium oxide, making it more suitable for fused silica polishing.

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 6particle size of cerium oxide is positively correlated with MRR, that is, the larger the particle size of abrasive, the greater the MRR.  However, there are also completely opposite situations, which are related to the synthesis of cerium oxide abrasives.  Cerium oxide particles with different sizes can be obtained by controlling the preparation conditions.  In the actual CMP process, excessive particle size or strong agglomera - tion can lead to more scratches [29], while too small particle size will cause more Ce residue on the surface of silica.  Therefore, when deter - mining the particle size, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the possible defects that may be introduced.  3. 2.  Effect of Ce3\u0087concentration At present, the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide is generally believed to be that Ce3\u0087plays a major role in the polishing process.  Ce3\u0087 forms Ce-O-Si bonds by chemically interacting with silica to form Ce-O- Si bonds.  Therefore, the concentration of Ce3\u0087has a significant influence on MRR.  In addition, it is also necessary to pay more attention to the influence of Ce3\u0087on the selection ratio and surface roughness.",
    "Lee J et al.  reduction.  Under high temperature isothermal conditions, the reaction time and hydrogen concentration are strictly controlled to prevent the agglomeration of cerium oxide.  The hydrogen reduction process and polishing mechanism are shown in Fig.  8.  As can be seen from Fig.  8(a) (b), the number of oxygen vacancies increases significantly, resulting in an increase in Ce3\u0087 concentration.  Fig.  8(c) shows that the number of Ce3\u0087on the surface of cerium oxide significantly increases after hydrogen reduction, promot - ing the formation of Ce-O-Si bond in the polishing process, thereby improving the polishing efficiency.  The Ce3\u0087concentrations obtained by hydrogen at different temper - atures are shown in Table 2, and the data in the table were obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  It can be seen that the concentration of Ce3\u0087increases with the increase of reaction temperature.  Cerium oxide particles (main particle size: 100nm) treated by hydrogen reduction at different temperatures were used to polish silica, and the results are shown in Fig.  9.  It can be seen from Fig.  9(a) that MRR increases with the increase of treatment temperature.",
    "As can be seen from Table 2, Ce3\u0087concentration is positively correlated with the tem- perature range of 400\u20131000 \u2103.  Therefore, within this temperature range, the higher the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the higher the MRR.  As can be seen from Fig.  9(b) - (e), the surface roughness does not fluctuate obviously, because the hydrogen reduction does not alter the basic physical properties of cerium oxide.  When the temperature of 1000 \u2103, the concentration of Ce3\u0087increased by 12. 7% and the MRR increased by 37. 7%, compared with that before reduction.  However, the polishing performance of ceria after hydrogen reduction at higher temperatures are not mentioned, so it is expected to further improve the polishing rate without reducing the surface quality.  It is suspected that the reason why the temperature did not increase further is that cerium oxide can aggregate at too high temperature.  Myong K K et al.  [31] controlled the concentration of Ce3\u0087on the surface of cerium oxide nanoparticles by ultrasonic treatment with deionized water or 15vol% hydrogen peroxide, in which the average particle size of ceria nanoparticles was 32. 6 (\u00b16. 1) nm.  The Ce3\u0087 concentration before treatment was 16. 3%, while after treatment it was 21. 1% (H2O2 treatment), 21.",
    "5% (ultrasonic treatment) and 25.  (H2O2 and ultrasonic treatment), respectively.  Therefore, the concen - tration of Ce3\u0087can be increased by hydrogen peroxide and ultrasonic treatment.  The relationship between Ce3\u0087concentration and the inter- action between ceria and silica was tested using AFM and QCM.  It was found that the higher the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the stronger the interaction between them.  However, the strong interaction also leads to the cerium particles easily remaining on the wafer surface after CMP, increasing the difficulty of cleaning after CMP.  Therefore, the concen - tration of Ce3\u0087should be adjusted appropriately to balance the perfor - mance of CMP and the possible difficulties that may be encountered in cleaning after CMP.  Netzband C et al.  [32] treated cerium oxide particles (average particle size: 68nm) with a concentration of 1. 0wt% using deionized water and different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0. 5\u20135wt%).  The surface of silica was polished with the treated slurry and commercial cerium oxide abrasive (average particle size: 50nm) to analyze the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration on MRR and surface roughness, as shown in Fig.  10: When hydrogen peroxide concentration was 0.",
    "5wt%, both the maximum MRR and the minimum surface roughness were obtained, which is very rare. Although the particle size is larger than that of commercial cerium oxide, the surface roughness after polishing is smaller than that of commercial cerium oxide. Furthermore, the Si3N4 surface was polished with the determined optimal slurry (ceria with a concentration of 1.0wt% and average particle size of 68nm, 0.5wt% hydrogen peroxide, pH 8), and the selection ratio of SiO2 to Si3N4 was 3:1. Although the selectivity is superior to than that of commercial cerium oxide slurry, there is still a large gap compared to 30:1 selection ratio required for the polishing process.

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 7It can be concluded that the concentration of Ce3\u0087can be changed through methods such as hydrogen reduction, controlling the calcina - tion temperature, adding hydrogen peroxide additives, and ultrasonic treatment.  A higher concentration of Ce3\u0087may not necessarily be better, and the subsequent cleaning process needs to be considered.  At the same time, the selection ratio between SiO2 and Si3N4 should be also considered.  In addition, the CMP performance of the dielectric can also be optimized through surface modification, which will be discussed in detail in the next section.  3. 3.  Effect of surface modification of cerium oxide 3. 3. 1.

At the same time, adding appropriate dispersants such as polyacrylamide (PPI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyr- rolidone (PVP), and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), can improve the stability of doped cerium oxide. The cerium oxide doped with La/Nd/Yb precipitated after one day. After adding 1vol% PVA, the prepared La/ Nd/Yb doped cerium oxide can remain stable for up to 7 days [37]. Cheng J et al.

It can be seen from Fig.  12 that the impurity distribution is uniform, and the doped particles are close to spherical shape, with little change compared to before doping.  The CMP results show that at pH 5, the dielectric MRR with doped cerium oxide nanoparticles is lower than that without doped cerium oxide at pH 5.  At pH 9. 5, the MRR of ceria nanoparticles doped with La, Nd and Yb increased by 20. 9 wt%, 29. 6 wt% and 4. 3wt%, respectively, compared to undoped cerium oxide.  After polishing with doped cerium oxide nanoparticles, the surface roughness of silicon oxide dielectric is 10\u00c5, which is less than 14\u00c5 using No. 2815 commercial cerium oxide.  This provides a reference for polishing abrasives under alkaline conditions.",
    "However, there is no consensus on the different results at different pH values.  acidic conditions is greater than that under alkaline conditions because of the coulombic force.  It is speculated that for doped ceria, the reason for the increase in MRR under alkaline conditions is the increase in Ce3\u0087concentration, but the reason for the decrease in MRR under acidic conditions remains to be studied.  Kim E et al.  [39] synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles by hydro - thermal method and doped with La or Nd with low molar concentration of 20% or high molar concentration of 50%, respectively.  The samples were marked as HTC (undoped ceria), NDC-L (ceria doped with 20% Nd), NDC-H (ceria doped with 50% Nd), LDC-L (ceria doped with 20% La), LDC-H (ceria doped with 50% La).  It is found that when the pH range is 4. 2\u20134. 5, the doped cerium oxide can significantly increase the MRR of silica, with a maximum value of 5000 \u00c5/min.  The XPS results of HTC, LDC-L, and NDC-L samples are shown in Fig.  13.  The Ce3\u0087con- centration was calculated according to the results in Fig.  13, and the values in the three samples of HTC, LDC-L, and NDC-L were 24. 54%, 30. 40% and 32.",
    "57%.  Therefore, the reason for the increase in MRR is that the addition of Nd or La increases the concentration of Ce3\u0087.  At the same time, the MRR of silicon nitride also improved, but only by a fraction compared to the increase in the MRR of silica.  Therefore, the selection ratio of SiO2 and Si3N4 polished with doped cerium oxide is also improved, which provides a way to improve the selectivity of silica to silicon nitride.  The surface roughness of silica obtained by high concentration Nd doping is 0. 135 nm, which is lower than that of commercial ceria slurry and pure ceria abrasive.  Therefore, the silica CMP performance with high MRR, high selectivity and low surface roughness can be obtained using cerium oxide doped with 50% Nd.  Ma J et al.  [40] studied the effect of doping different concentrations of La in cerium oxide at pH 9 on CMP performance.  That is, the x values in Ce1\u0000xLaxO2 were changed to 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3, respectively.  The MRR values were 59. 31\u00b19. 95, 81. 75\u00b113. 53, 92. 43\u00b116. 34 and 101. 12\u00b115.",

In conclusion, doping lanthanide metals with positive binding energy to oxygen vacancy can improve MRR and surface quality without changing the surface morphology of cerium oxide basically, and also provide a physical modification approach for improving the selectivity. However, under similar acidic conditions, the opposite results were obtained in the above paper, which may be caused by the difference of doping con- centration. The mechanism of pH changes affecting doping and Ce3\u0087 concentration still needs further study. 3.3.2.

According to the types of materials, they can be divided into inorganic/inorganic, inor- ganic/organic, organic/inorganic and organic/organic materials, with the former as the core material and the latter as the shell material [41].  The stability of nano ceria is a challenge in the field of materials.  In the core-shell structures, shell materials can change the reactivity and thermal stability of the core material, so as to improve the stability of the whole material.  At the same time, it can also improve the polishing performance of cerium oxide nanoparticles [42].  Chen Y et al.  [43] synthesized polystyrene (PS)/cerium oxide abra- sive by chemical precipitation method.  The CMP results showed that the MRR and root mean square (RMS) with pure ceria nanoparticles were 208\u00b145nm/min and 0. 43\u00b10. 03 nm, respectively, while the values obtained using the PS/CeO 2 core-shell composite abrasives were 186 \u00b129nm/min and 0. 28\u00b10. 04 nm, respectively.",
    "Although the MRR obtained with the core-shell structure is smaller than that with pure cerium oxide, it is still larger than most abrasives due to the advantage of cerium oxide abrasives themselves.  with core-shell structure abrasives is 34. 9% lower than that with pure cerium oxide, with fewer scratches, which greatly contributes to the surface quality of the polished wafer.  The reason for the reduction of scratches may be that the prepared composite abrasives have good structural stability.  Fig.  14 shows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the abra- sives before and after CMP.  It can be seen that the abrasive can still maintain the spherical shape after CMP, indicating good structural sta- bility, which is also the main reason for the improvement of the surface quality after CMP.  It can be explained that the improvement of CMP performance with the core-shell structure abrasives is the synergistic effect of organic core and inorganic shell materials.  In the CMP process, the PS core increases the contact area between the shell abrasive and the wafer, thus reducing roughness and mechanical damage.",

The polishing efficiency and quality were greatly improved compared to the result obtained with commercial ceria (MRR 87nm/min, RMS 0.44 nm). This may be due to the low particle density of H-mSiO 2-CeO 2 abrasives, resulting in an in- crease in the number of active particles and the dielectric MRR. In addition, the particle size of cerium oxide will decrease during the synthesis process. From the previous description of the influence of cerium oxide particle size on polishing performance, it can be seen that a reduction of particle size will lead to an increase of Ce3\u0087concentration, thus also improving the polishing efficiency.

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 11It can be concluded that polishing performance, including polishing efficiency and surface quality can be improved by core-shell structure.  From this perspective, the advantages of other composite materials can make up for the lack of cerium oxide abrasives.  3. 3. 3.  Modifier - Chemical modification The chemical modification of cerium oxide nanoparticles can in- crease the cohesion, improve the dispersion, reduce the surface energy, eliminate the surface charge, and weaken the surface polarity.  The usual approach is to add coupling agents or surfactants [45].  Wortman-Otto K M et al.  [46] found by the UV\u2013visible spectrum that additives containing carboxylic acid functional groups can inhibit the MRR of the oxide, such as benzoic acid (BA), glutamic acid (Glu), 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA).  Additives containing amino acids or hydroxyl functional groups can promote the MRR of oxides, such as dextrose (Dex), PA, glycine (Gly), and hydroquinone (HQ).",
    "The inhibi - tion mechanism of additives with carboxylic acid functional groups is that these additives have strong adsorption force on cerium oxide sur- face at pH 4, resulting in reduced contact between cerium oxide and the surface of the wafers, thus reducing MRR.  a weak elec- trostatic interaction between additives with amino acid functional groups and cerium oxide nanoparticles.  Amino acids with a ratio of 1:1 between carboxylic acid and amine can replace the binding oxygen on the surface of cerium oxide to achieve the purpose of increasing Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087.  Dex and HQ can be used as redox reagent to regulate the concentration of Ce3\u0087.  However, researches based on chemical modifi - cation is relatively limited compared with physical modification.  At present, there are few reports on the surface morphology of the SiO2 wafer CMP with chemically modified cerium oxide.  In summary, the development of ceria CMP slurry needs to consider not only MRR, but also the defects introduced to the wafer surface.  Uneven particle size distribution can cause an increase in WIWNU.",
    "Strong acid/alkaline polishing slurry can cause certain corrosion to the surface of the wafer and also have a certain impact on the environment.  to comprehensively consider multiple factors to achieve a relative balance between MRR and surface quality.  In order to promote the industrial production of cerium oxide polishing slurry, subsequent research should comprehensively improve the performance of the polishing slurry.  A green and environmentally friendly cerium oxide CMP slurry with high MRR, low defects, and industrial production potential will be the future development trend.  4. Removal of cerium oxide particles during post CMP cleaning The minimum feature size of integrated circuits has been reduced to 7nm and below, post-CMP cleaning faces a more serious challenge of obtaining smooth and defect-free surfaces [47].  The most critical factor for reducing the yield of silicon-based semiconductor devices is the ex- istence of defects [48].  Cerium oxide nanoparticles mainly play a role in forming strong Ce-O-Si bonds in dielectric CMP process [49], and are easily absorbed on the wafer surface with other pollutions after CMP, which may lead to scratches and other defects.",
    "Therefore, the cleaning of cerium oxide nanoparticles after CMP becomes particularly important.  surface of small size ceria particles than in large size ceria particles.  Therefore, most large size cerium oxide particles can be removed by physical cleaning, but small size particles often need to be removed by chemical cleaning [50].  4. 1.  Introduction of additives Kim J et al.  [51] added glycerin to deionized water as an additive to study the effects of viscosity and temperature on particle removal during post CMP cleaning process by inductively coupled plasma mass spec- trometry (ICP-MS).  It was found that as the glycerin concentration increased, the Ce3\u0087concentration on the cleaned wafer surface decreased gradually.  Therefore, the viscosity of the cleaning solution increases with the increase of glycerin concentration, and the corre - sponding resistance to the particles also increases, which facilitates the removal of cerium oxide particles.  By comparing the experimental re- sults at 0\u2103 and 20\u2103, it is found that the lower the temperature, the higher the viscosity of the cleaning solution.  Glycerol can be used as an effective additive for removing cerium oxide particles.",
    "However, the paper lacks the analysis of the surface morphology of the cleaned wafers.  wafers plays a decisive role in the performance of semiconductor devices, so it needs to be further studied.  Yan M et al.  [52] studied the effect of adding Gly, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1. 2-bis-(3-aminopropylamino) ethylenediamine (TAD) to the cleaning solution on the removal of residual cerium oxide after polishing.  The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) after cleaning are shown in Fig.  15.  It was found that when 0. 15 wt% EDTA was added into the cleaning solution with pH 11, the particle removal efficiency (PRE) reached the highest (99%), and the surface roughness decreased to 0. 45 nm.  The PRE of the cleaning solution with Gly and TAD added was 96. 8% and 93. 8%, respectively, and the surface roughness was 0. 95 nm and 1. 41 nm, respectively.",
    "Through the analysis of the mechanism of action, it was found that EDTA broke the Si-O bond through the downward cutting effect of carboxyl functional groups in EDTA, and formed a soluble complex with Ce3\u0087through the complexa - tion reaction. ceria in the cleaning process and obtain better surface morphology. 4.2. Water cleaning Yun J et al. [53] improved the polishing and cleaning process by first polishing with cerium oxide slurry, and then polishing and cleaning the wafer simultaneously with remaining cerium oxide slurry on pad and deionized water (DIW), referred to as the ceria/DIW combined process. The process steps are shown in Fig. 16. The entire process is set at 60s, Fig. 14.TEM images of the used PS/SiO 2 composite abrasives (a) and PS/CeO 2 composite abrasives (b) after CMP [43]. X.

Under this process, the particle area ratio (the ratio of the area of cerium particles to the total area) decreased from 9.035% to 0.839%. The Ce concentration decreased from 1552.55 ppb to 83.25 ppb through ICP-MS testing. The surface roughness is 0.150 nm. Therefore, cleaning efficiency and surface quality have reached a higher level. Liu P et al. [54] prepared N2 water and CO2 water using a gas dis- solved water system. The pH values of DIW, N2 and CO2 water are 6.2, 5.2 and 3.9, respectively.

The residual cerium oxide particles on the wafer surface are easy to agglomerate after N2 water and DIW cleaning, but the residual particles obtained after CO2 water cleaning are relatively dispersed.  The experiments were conducted by changing the concentration of CO2 in CO2 water, and it was found that PRE of ceria decreased with the decrease of CO2 concentration.  The surface roughness is 0. 613 \u00b10. 025 nm when the particle size is large, while the surface roughness is 0. 077\u00b10. 010 nm when the particle size is small.  The PRE of ceria obtained through CO2 water cleaning is the highest and the surface roughness is the lowest, whether the cerium oxide particles with large or small size are cleaned.",
    "The CO2 water cleaning mechanism is (as shown in Fig.  the substrate surface.  Lee J et al.  [55] used tangential flow filtration (TFF) system to filter out cerium oxide particles with smaller particle size (D50nm) for dielectric CMP, and then cleaned them with DIW.  This method increased the PRE of water cleaning by 18. 1%, achieving performance similar to SC1 (NH 4OH:H 2O2:H2O\uff0c1:1:5) solution.  When using water cleaning, the PRE of ceria can be increased by improving the process time or dissolving gas in water.  Adding CO2 to water provides a new way for removing small-sized cerium oxide nanoparticles.  Although the TFF system improves the PRE of ceria for water cleaning, it is only suitable for the using large-sized cerium oxide particles for CMP.  Water cleaning can achieve larger PRE of ceria without causing secondary pollution, which not only saves costs but also protects the environment.  In line with the concept of green and envi- ronmental protection, water cleaning is a big trend in the future.  4. 3.",

The most commonly assisted physical cleaning methods are polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) brushing [56,57] and ultrasonic cleaning [58].  Seo J et al.  [50] studied the cleaning efficiency (CE) of SC1 cleaning solution with different component proportions under ultrasonic on cerium oxide particles with size of 10, 30 and 90nm.  It was found that when H2O2 (30wt%) accounted for 43% and NH4OH (30wt%) accounted for 57%, that is, the molar concentration was basically equal, the CE of the three different particle size abrasives was relatively high, all of which were 99%, exceeding the CE of the standard SC1 solution (19%, 58%, 94%).  This is because the molar concentrations of peroxide and hydroxide are essentially equal, and the concentration of HO2- in the solution reaches its maximum value.  HO2- removes cerium oxide parti- cles from the wafer surface by breaking the Si-O bond in Ce-O-Si.  The removal process is shown in Fig.  18.  This method can effectively solve the cleaning problem of small-sized cerium oxide nanoparticles.",
    "How- ever, the literature did not mention the analysis of the surface morphology of the cleaned wafers.  method of high efficiency particle removal can be promoted.  Sahir S et al.  [59] found that both megasonic cleaning and PVA brush cleaning could only achieve higher PRE for cerium oxide with larger particle size, while chemical cleaning is more effective in removing ceria with small particle size.  When SC1 was used to clean wafers for less than 10min, the PRE of ceria exceeded 95% for ceria nanoparticles with particle sizes of 30,60 and 90nm.  SC1 cleaning solution mainly gener - ates relatively strong electrostatic repulsion by changing the surface charge of particles and wafers, and has a slight etching effect to achieve a better cleaning effect.  Diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF) can be used to remove cerium oxide particles through lower shear mechanism and etching.  However, it has a good effect on ceria only with small particle size.  For cerium oxide particles with size of 30nm and 60nm, the PRE can reach more than 95% by cleaning the wafer surface with DHF for 60s.",

For 30nm cerium oxide, the PRE reaches 99%, but for 90nm particles, the PRE is less than 20%.

Because the cleaning solution has no etching effect, the surface roughness obtained is better than that obtained by SC1 and SPM.

Since most cleaning methods have a certain degree of selectivity for particle size, it is necessary to compare the performance of cleaning solutions towards various particle size.",

In addition, room temperature cleaning processes are also a focus of research and development.

Conclusion With the reduction of feature size in integrated circuits, the perfor - mance and surface residue requirements of dielectric layer CMP based on cerium oxide abrasives have become increasingly stringent.  This article mainly summarizes the factors that affect the CMP performance of cerium oxide abrasives, including the particle size of cerium oxide abrasives, the value of Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087and surface modification.",
    "The particle size can be controlled by changing the calcination temperature or preparation method.  particle size needs to be determined based on the surface quality of CMP chips.  Ce3\u0087enhances chemical interactions dur- ing wafer CMP process by forming Ce-O-Si bonds on the surface of silica, thereby improving MRR.  The concentration of Ce3\u0087can be changed by methods such as hydrogen reduction or introducing oxygen vacancies with other additives.  Physical and chemical modifications can alter the inherent chemical properties of cerium oxide without altering its surface morphology.  This provides a reference for the changes in Ce3\u0087con- centration and the improvement of selection rate.  In addition, Ce par- ticles will remain on the surface of the chip after dielectric CMP, which will have a serious impact on the subsequent process of integrated cir- cuit manufacturing and even cause failure.",
    "Therefore, this article ana- lyzes the method of cleaning cerium oxide particles after CMP, which improves the cleaning efficiency of cerium oxide by adding additives such as glycerol or complexing agents containing carboxyl functional groups, or by dissolving gas in water.  the best cleaning effect with the lowest concentration of reagents for different cerium oxide particle sizes.  The improvement of MRR and the reduction of defects usually cannot be achieved simultaneously, so more systematic research is needed to balance the relationship between the two.  Furthermore, the development trend of cerium oxide abrasive CMP slurry and post cleaning is prospected, and it will be the optimal choice for cerium oxide abrasive CMP and post cleaning to be environmentally friendly and efficient.

Hong Jin Kim Additional information is available at the end of the chapter Abstract Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of the most essential processes in semi - conductor manufacturing.  Its importance becomes highly underscored at the advanced device toward sub 14 nm scaling.  The fundamental mechanism of CMP is to create soften surface layer by chemical reaction and then, mechanical force by abrasive particles remove soften layer.  The role of CMP is not only material removal, but also planarization, surface smoothening, uniformity control, defect reduction and more.  Moreover, semiconductor yield enhancement is sensitively influenced by CMP processing.  Surface scratching, which is generated by CMP in nature, is considered as \u2018killer defect\u2019 in semiconductor manufac - turing.",
    "Hence, to achieve proper CMP performance without surface scratching, under - standing and development of abrasive particles are crucially important.  applications and challenges associated with abrasive particle technol - ogy including synthesis (up to nanoparticle scale), tribochemical reaction, abrasive surface zeta potential behavior, particle size and its distribution will be discussed.  Keywords: semiconductor manufacturing, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), slurry, silica abrasive, ceria abrasive, alumina abrasive, advanced abrasive materials 1.  Introduction Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has been used for several decades in semiconductor manufacturing since its development at 1980s [ 1\u20135].  The original purpose of CMP is to pla - narize wafer surface both locally and globally, which enable subsequent lithographic pattern - ing with proper depth of focus [ 1\u20135].  However, as device shrinkage continues, it has become critical process for device fabrication, and its applications play a pivotal role in semiconductor process since transistor scaling becomes beyond 14 nm [ 5\u20139].  The role of CMP and planarized wafer associated with lithography patterning is shown in Figure 1 schematically [ 1, 4].  \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).  Licensee IntechOpen.

    "Surface topography hinders conformal deposition of photoresist, leading to distorted pat - terning.  Furthermore, advantages of employment of CMP in semiconductor manufacturing are [ 4, 5]: (1) elimination of step coverage burden, (2) defect removal from prior process steps, (3) surface smoothening in wafer scale, and (4) enablement of metal gate formation at sub 14 nm device.  The fundamental mechanism of CMP process is [ 1\u20134]: (1) Material surface becomes soften by chemical reaction with slurry, (2) Mechanical force by abrasive particle in the slurry removes soften layer and step height reduction, (3) Material surface reacts with slurry chemical to make surface soften layer again and repeat (1) \u2013 (3).  Therefore, chemistry and abrasive particles in the slurry determines CMP performances.  This procedure is given in Figure 2 .  With this process, fast material removal across the wafer with planarization can be achieved.",
    "From the abrasive perspective, abrasive-wafer contact model on removal rate has been published in many literatures which emphasize abrasive particle size (and size dis - tribution) and shape, and abrasive hardness.  [ 1\u201310 ].  Recently, sub 14 nm semiconductor scaling has developed device integration scheme to 3-dimensional tran - sistor formation such as fin field-effect transistor, therefore device process flow becomes much more complicated than previous device node [ 6\u20139, 11, 12 ].  Hence, application of CMP extends to transistor formation, and importance of CMP process becomes highly underscored.  Figure 3(a) shows polisher equipment and wafer polishing processing.  Polishing head holds wafers by vacuum and it rotates on the polishing pad.  Slurry is delivered by slurry arm and polishing pad conditioner refreshes polishing pad surface as each wafer processing, which results in global planarization and polishing.  Whereas, in microscale observation, compli - cated interaction among pad asperity-slurry (abrasive and chemistry)-wafer surface occurs during CMP processing, which is depicted in Figure 3 .",
    "According to semiconductor process development, CMP process itself has developed its equipment, consumables, polishing func - tions and slurries to improve performance. surface topography (roughness), corrosion and post CMP defects. The definitions of them are: Figure 1. The concept of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Non-planarized topography becomes planarized surface by CMP.Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 184",
    "Removal Rate (RR) = (pre CMP thickness \u2013post CMP thickness ) / (polishing time ) Within Wafer Uniformity = Film thickness sigma post CMP / Film mean thickness post CMP Selectivity (A : B) = RR of A material / RR of B material Planarization is commonly measured by step height reduction rate.  These performances are closely related with device yield and electrical performances.  For example, CMP-induced microscratch defect ( Figure 4 ) is detrimental to device yield [ 3, 5]; transistor resistance is strongly influenced by post CMP uniformity, and residual material blocks subsequent pat - terning.  CMP performances are determined by multiple CMP process factors; however, CMP slurry is the most influencing parameter.  CMP slurry consists of abrasive particles and chemi - cal components such as pH adjuster, dispersant, polymeric additives, oxidizer, and passivation agent, depending on polishing purpose to provide proper surface modification of material.",
    "As described in Figure 3 , direct contact between abrasive particle and wafer surface removes material, thus, properties and characteristics of abrasive particle and their understanding are inevitable to optimize CMP process. until recent device manufacturing. They are silica-based abrasive, ceria-based abrasive, and alumina-based abra - sive. However, CMP is indispensable process for future semiconductor fabrication and it needs development of new abrasives for the success of new designed device and matured manufac - turing. Figure 5 shows CMP abrasive market trend in semiconductor industry [ 14]. Its growth expectation for the next 4 years is about 30% increase from 2016. This chapter introduces abra - sive particles and their applications to CMP process for semiconductor manufacturing. Figure 2. The schematic mechanism of material removal by CMP. Figure 3.

    "2.  Abrasive for dielectric CMP A dielectric material in semiconductor processing refers to insulating materials and mostly it indicates all kinds of silicon oxide materials [ 5].  Most dielectric CMP applications focus on transistor formation, which is called as front end of the line (FEOL) process.  And dielectric CMP requires either oxide bulk CMP or CMP stop on \u2018stopper\u2019 material.  For the stop on CMP case, oxide material is removed by CMP and CMP stops when stopper material is exposed.  Shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP and interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP are representative dielectric CMP applications.  STI CMP process (stop on \u2018silicon nitride\u2019) is described in Figure 6 [3] as an example of dielectric CMP.  The stopper materials are mostly silicon nitride or poly- silicon in FEOL process.  For dielectric CMP purpose, two \u2013 three major abrasives are used in the advanced node semiconductor manufacturing.  2. 1.  Silica-based slurry and silica abrasive As briefly described in the introduction, CMP mechanism is soft layer removal by abrasive particle.  This section introduces silica particle as slurry abrasive.  During dielectric CMP pro - cess, silicon oxide surface reacts with OH\u2212 from the slurry solution and forms silicon hydrox - ide, Si(OH)4.",

Then silicon oxide surface is exposed and hydration occurs again. This process is repeating until silicon oxide disappears. From Figure 2 , soft layer can be considered as Si(OH)4 in this case. The hydration rate is influenced by the concentration of OH\u2212 ions in the solution, thus alkaline environment can accelerate surface hydration and make fast material removal by fast reaction [ 2, 15\u201316]. Therefore high pH silica-abrasive slurry is favorable to obtain high removal rate. Two common synthesizing methods of silica abrasives are commercially used in the semiconductor industry. One is fumed process and the other is colloidal process [ 5, 17\u201319]. The typical abrasive images Figure 6. Procedure of shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP.

SiCl 4 + 2H 2 + O 2 \uf0e0 SiO 2 + 4HCl With this method, early development of silica abrasive particle size is larger than 300 \u00c5, but development of filtration and post treatment enables to control the abrasive size below 150 \u00c5.  The commercial fumed silica abrasive slurry for dielectric CMP has high abrasive concentra - tion to achieve enough removal rate.  However, high abrasive concentration caused scratch defects, easy to agglomerate and clogging problem in slurry delivery system or filter.  Figure 8 shows example of clogged silica abrasive, which leads to significant defects on the wafer at post CMP.  The whitish particles are silica abrasive in the slurry loop system.  Therefore recent device manufacturing use high percentage of fumed silica abrasive slurry less and less, and forecast expects less usage of fumed silica abrasive as shown in Figure 5 .",

By ion exchange, sodium ion is eliminated and colloidal silica is formed to be used as CMP slurry abrasive.  Colloidal silica abrasive slurry has much lower removal rate than fumed silica abrasive although it gives much lower scratch defect perfor - mance by its spherical shape and small size.  To enhance removal rate of dielectric material by colloidal silica, organic cation is added as removal booster [ 16].  It changes colloidal silica abra - sive surface charge from negative into positive and coulombic attraction force between abra - sive and dielectric surface, which is negative, accelerates removal rate.  As shown in Figure 9(a) , surface zeta potential behavior with respect to pH [ 26] can support this mechanism.  Schematic of enhanced removal rate by colloidal silica abrasive is given in the same Figure.  pH control is critical to this case.",

For instance, Pan et al.  presented silane modified silica abrasive particle preparation to mitigate gelation of colloidal silica due to high chemically active hydroxyl group from silica surface.  The siloxane groups in silane and hydroxyl groups in silica surface generate hydrolysis condensation reaction, which results in surface zetapotential change to improve dispersion stability [ 27].  2. 2.  Ceria abrasive for dielectric CMP slurry Although high removal rate, low cost of ownership and effective planarization are obtained by silica abrasive, selectivity control and low scratch defect requirements bring ceria-based abrasive to be universally used in dielectric CMP of advanced node semiconductor manu - facturing.  And recent dielectric CMP uses ceria-based slurry much more than before (refers to Figure 5 ).  The CMP mechanism by ceria-based slurry is different from silica-based slurry.  Instead of mechanical removal by silica abrasive, ceria abrasive uses surface interaction with silicon oxide dominantly, which is.",

Figure 10 .  Therefore, ceria abrasive surface charge control is important in determining CMP perfor - mance.  The surface charge behavior can be indicated by ceria zeta potential property [ 31].  As shown in Figure 11(a) , isoelectric point (IEP) of ceria is ~pH 8 (at acidic: positive charge, at alkaline: negative charge) and surface potential is opposite to silicon oxide at acidic envi - ronment.  Thus, most ceria-abrasive slurry pH is less than 8 to facilitate Si-O-Ce formation.  Similar to silica abrasive synthesis, two types of ceria-base abrasive are commonly synthe - sized for CMP applications [ 5, 31, 32 ].  They are calcined ceria abrasive and wet (or colloidal) ceria abrasive.  Calcined synthesis is based on solid-state oxidation process.  Raw ceria mate - rial is oxidized followed by mechanical crushing to make them small particles.  And filtra - tion removes large particles.",
    "Depending on crushing condition and filtration, calcined ceria abrasive size can be controlled. process uses precipitation procedure in liquid state. Seed ceria nuclei in an aqueous cerium solution grows and forms ceria (or cerium hydroxide) particles. Ceria abrasive made by wet process has spherical shape and nar - row particle size distribution compared with calcined process. These synthesis methods and typical ceria abrasive images from each method are shown in Figure 11(b) \u2013(d) schematically Figure 10.

Calcined ceria abrasive slurry pro - vides steady removal rate.  Wet ceria abrasive slurry shows relatively lower removal rate than calcined ceria abrasive, however, the most critical advantage of wet ceria abrasive slurry is scratch defect improvement due to small and regular shape of abrasive particle.  Recent study by Seo revealed Ce surface oxidation state had significant influence on the CeO2 interaction to silicate and they investigated the effect of concentration of Ce3+ ions on the affinity to silicate ions and wet ceria particle size effect on the adsorption of silicate [ 35, 36 ].  Higher concentra - tion of Ce3+ ions increased adsorption affinity with silicate ions and larger ceria abrasive has Figure 11.

In addition to calcined and wet process, flux method to synthesize ceria abrasive particle has proposed to overcome limitation of cal - cined or wet process [ 37].  It uses cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as starting material and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2)-DI mixture as solvent.  Through precipitation, hydrothermal reaction and centrifuging process, narrow size distribu - tion with desirable characteristics ceria abrasives synthesis are demonstrated [ 37].  Ceria or ceria-based slurry application in CMP is increasing and advanced slurries with ceria abrasive are emerging in the semiconductor industry.  Ultrafine (or nano-sized) ceria abrasive and com - posite abrasive will be introduced in Section 5.  3.  Abrasive for tungsten CMP Tungsten has been used for metal interconnection and contact formation.  Many candidate metals have been developed to replace tungsten; however, tungsten is still standard metal for sub 14 nm contact formation due to its excellent electromigration and diffusion barrier performance [ 3, 38 ].  The CMP mechanism of tungsten was proposed by Kaufmann firstly [ 39].",
    "A pristine tungsten surface is oxidized by oxidizer at acidic condition and it transforms to tungsten oxide (WOx).  depends on solution and chemistry.  Tungsten oxide plays a role as passivation layer to protect subsurface tungsten from dissolution or cor - rosion.  And tungsten oxide is easy to be removed by mechanical force of abrasive since its hardness is less than pure tungsten.  This process is repeated until CMP stops.  Therefore, role of chemistry (in particular oxidizer) is important in tungsten CMP.  Among many kinds of oxidizer, ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3-) is the most successful one [ 3, 5].  The schematic description of tungsten CMP mechanism is given in Figure 12 .  The common and commercially avail - able slurry for tungsten CMP has alumina-base and silica-base abrasives [ 3, 5].  At sub 14 nm logic device fabrication, tungsten CMP is the most important process to enable transistor formation.  It requires superior planarity and extremely accurate uniformity control.  For this purpose, alumina abrasive showed better planarity and selectivity performance.",
    "Hence its utilization for bulk tungsten CMP is commonly adopted in advanced device manufacturing. shape Poor size distribution Mass production Relatively high scratchMean particle size (nm): 120\u2013170 Relatively low oxide removal rate Spherical shape Uniform size distribution High cost Relatively low scratch Table 1.

    "Alumina abrasive has been synthesized by alum process and calcination [ 18].  For CMP appli - cation, alpha-alumina abrasive is commonly used.  Hardness of alumina abrasive is much higher than tungsten and tungsten oxide, therefore it is easy to make scratch defect on the sur - face.  Moreover, due to the surface charge difference between alumina and tungsten at acidic region, attractive force retains alumina abrasive on the wafer surface.  Recently, composite alumina abrasive with polymeric material has been introduced in the industry due to defect concern at advanced node semiconductor [ 38].  Silica base slurry utilization on tungsten CMP is usually for non-selective CMP purpose (polishing both tungsten and dielectric material) because its selectivity with oxide is not as high as alumina abrasive slurry.  Tungsten CMP is driven by chemical effect more than mechanical abrasion, removal rate strongly depends on chemical components (oxidizer, surfactant, and stabilizer) and activation condition (for example, process temperature) [ 39\u201341 ].",
    "Therefore adequate combinations among them are essential to provide desired CMP performances. significant in tungsten CMP than dielectric CMP. Yttrium, ceria, zirconium and composite abrasives have been tried and under development for tungsten CMP applications [3]. 4. Abrasive for copper CMP Copper is introduced in semiconductor manufacturing for metal interconnection application mid-1990s and now it is standard metal for back end of the line interconnection [ 2\u20134, 10]. Accordingly, CMP for copper has been highlighted due to its process challenges. Like tung - sten CMP, copper CMP mechanism is based on Kaufman\u2019s model. Chemical reaction from slurry produces oxidized copper and abrasive particle removes oxidized copper. The major components of copper CMP slurry are abrasive, oxidizer, inhibitor, surfactant and chelating agent. The challenges of copper CMP are scratch defects and copper corrosion. Corrosion is Figure 12. The mechanism of tungsten CMP.Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408193",
    "Figure 13.  Synthesis of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive (reprinted from Ref.  [ 33] with permission from authors). mostly induced by chemical in the slurry and most of scratch defects are driven by abrasive particle.  In particular, hardness of copper is lower than most abrasive particles.  Therefore, smaller size of abrasive with spherical shape and less abrasive content are favorable to the slurry formulation.  The common copper CMP abrasives are alumina and colloidal silica [ 3, 10].  However, at advanced semiconductor manufacturing, colloidal silica abrasive becomes prevalent because it has appreciable polish rate of barrier material (tantalum/tantalum nitride).  The copper removal rate and CMP performances are sensitively influenced by chem - istries and components in slurry in conjunction with silica abrasive characteristics.  Most of copper CMP slurry researches have focused on chemistry perspective instead of abrasives.  5.  Advanced abrasives for future CMP applications One of the most important requirements of CMP process in semiconductor application is scratch defect reduction, which has mentioned in this chapter several times.  For abrasive per - spective, smaller size abrasive particle is favorable for scratch defect.",
    "Therefore, recent abrasive technology has focused on nano-sized abrasive synthesis with minimized agglomeration.  cerium hydroxide or nano-ceria) abrasive slurry has been introduced due to its potential scratch defect reduction [ 33\u201334, 42 \u201343].  The synthesis procedure of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive is given in Figure 13 .  Transmission electron microscope image of calcined ceria abrasive and nano-sized abrasive is compared in Figure 14 [44].  Single abrasive size becomes as small as 5 nm.  Even agglomer - ated abrasive size is less than 20 nm.  Tanaka et al. , showed removal rate and selectivity control by changing additives [ 33\u201334 ].  However, CMP mechanism of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive is not clearly understood yet.  Han et al.  reported polishing pad surface roughness control is critical to maintain removal rate stability with nano-sized cerium hydroxide abra - sive [ 44].  Kim proposed particle coverage model on the wafer as material removal mechanism with nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive [ 43].  In order to apply nano-sized cerium hydrox - ide abrasive for dielectric CMP, role of chemistry to enhance removal rate with selectivity control needs to be further explored.",
    "Composite abrasive has drawn attention to the semiconductor industry recently. own unique properties. Some of them are very attractive and some of them are not good for desired CMP performances. Tries to combine advantages only from different abrasives have triggered ceria-silica composite abrasive development [ 45\u201348 ]. Researchers have paid attention to ceria-coated silica as next generation CMP slurry abrasive. Zhao et al. Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 194",

Peedikakkandy et al.  synthesized mono- dispersed ceria coated silica nanoparticles by micro-emulsion method and chemical precipita - tion process [ 46].  About~10 nm crystalline ceria over silica with spherical shape and overall particle size <100 nm abrasive is successfully obtained.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) directly shows evidence of homogenous nucleation of ceria particles and heterogeneous nucleation of silica particle with uniform, distinctive and crystalline ceria shell.",

The advantage of mesoporous silica is its significant elastic recovery ability combined with ductile behavior. Chen et al. synthesized solid silica core via conventional St\u00f6ber procedure and shell silica encapsulating the core by means of modified St\u00f6ber process. It uses vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) as silica source and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as structure directing agent. Well defined spherical shape abrasives are successfully achieved and it shows clearly core-shell structure. The thickness of mesoporous silica shell is controlled by VTMS amount during synthesis. With this abrasive, higher removal rate of thermal silicon dioxide film and lower surface roughness are exhibited. Polymeric composite has drawn attention to CMP society due to its potential scratch defect reduction. Chen et al. reported polymer based core-shell abrasive aiming to reduce scratch Figure 14.

    "defect by CMP.  The core abrasive is spherical polystyrene (PS) and ceria is selected as shell abrasive [ 49].  The mechanism of low scratch and minimize wafer damage is cushion effect of soft polymer core abrasive.  In-situ chemical precipitation with mixture of deionized water, PS spheres, cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O), and hexamethyleneteramine is used for this hybrid abrasive synthesis.  As shown in Figure 15 , it is clearly observed uniformly dis - tributed ceria particles on the PS core, indicating the formation of core/shell structured abra - sive particle.  The ceria particle size is about 10 nm and face centered cubic structure which is confirmed by XRD and SAED pattern.  Based on CMP test with thermal oxide film, PS/ceria hybrid abrasive slurry demonstrates lower removal rate, fewer scratches, and lower surface roughness are compared with ceria abrasive slurry.  Nano-sized ceria abrasive is already used in the semiconductor manufacturing.  Ceria-silica or silica-silica composite abrasive is still under development stage although several unique synthesizes are suggested and demonstrate promising CMP data.  Most of literatures with composite abrasive focus on material removal rate and surface quality.",
    "However, CMP appli - cation needs more performances.  abrasives have to avoid agglomeration, need to robust abrasive stability, require optimized chemistry, and more CMP performances such as selectivity and defectivity must be fulfilled.  New materials CMP has emerged along with new device introduction and device node shrinkage, from ultra-soft materials such as porous low-k and photoresist to highly non- reactive metal such as ruthenium (Ru) [ 3\u20135, 50, 51 ].  Ultra-soft material CMP needs very soft abrasive or even abrasive-free slurry development [ 5].  Ru is little chemical reactive metal with high hardness.  And it relies more on mechanical force to remove Ru layer than chemical dissolution.  Moreover, RuO4, which can be produced by slurry chemistry, is toxical gas [ 50, 51].  Therefore Ru CMP has a lot of limitation to achieve enough removal rate by CMP.  Cobalt (Co) is the most potential candidate metal for replacing tungsten as contact metal (or replac - ing Ta/TaN as barrier metal) and its CMP slurry abrasive development is upmost challenge for device fabrication [ 52\u201354 ].",
    "Known issues by Co CMP are residual abrasive particle defects and Co corrosion. 15. (a) SEM images and (b) TEM images of PS/ceria composite abrasive (Reprinted by permission from Ref. [ 49], Copyright 2016 Springer Nature).Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 196",
    "also neighboring materials CMP for proper selectivity.  Most of new materials CMP slurry is based on silica abrasive and chemistry optimization has been underscored.  However, it still has a lot of opportunities to develop abrasives as well.  Carbon based materials (either carbon nanotube or graphene) have drawn intense interests to the semiconductor industry for a long time.  For CMP perspective, carbon-based material polishing, which has been rarely reported, is big challenge to abrasive development due to its high hardness.  6.  Abrasive control in semiconductor fab The role of abrasive in CMP application is to obtain enough material removal rate, desired selectivity and low defect (residual particle and scratch) performance.  In addition to develop advanced abrasive material and synthesis, abrasive size distribution and dispersive ability in the solution has been developed to control large particle count.  Particle size distribution is raw abrasive material nature resulting from synthesis, however, slurry distribution system and filtration can control large particles and agglomeration from the slurry without CMP per - formance degradation.",
    "In high volume semiconductor manufacturing fab, slurry distribution system is considered as infrastructure instead of equipment [ 18, 55 ].  slurry blending and dispense, (4) daytank (or standby tank) with stirrer, (5) looping to tools.  Figure 16 shows simplified distribution system.  Slurry is being circulated in the loop until it is used for CMP.  Abrasive agglomeration is induced by shear stress, temperature change and chemistry variation if proper filtration is not implemented [ 56].  The location of filters from slurry distribution system is selected care - fully.  More filtration drops slurry flow pressure quickly by filter itself.  Very fine filter will removes most abrasives, which results in low removal rate.  Different slurry needs different type of filter and filtration at different locations; however global loop filtration and point of use (POU) filtration at polishing equipment are quite standard [ 18, 56, 57 ].  Global filter size is normally >10 \u03bcm, which is bigger than POU filter to avoid flow pressure drop.  POU filter size is smaller than 1 \u03bcm.  Yi Wei et al. , showed agglomeration behavior of different slurries.  Figure 16.  Slurry delivery facilities in semiconductor manufacturing fab.",

    "Colloidal silica abrasive agglomeration is more sensitive to shear stress than ceria abrasive.  The most important challenge of filtration is plugging by abrasives.  Three plugging mecha - nisms in filtration are well known, which are cake formation, gradual plugging, and complete plugging [ 58].  Cake formation is driven by particles build up on the filter surface, gradual plugging is induced by particles building up on the pore, and compete plugging indicates pore blocking by particles.  Depending on particle size, deformability, and agglomeration, filtration procedure can be optimized.  The most commonly used filter in CMP slurry is \u2018graded density depth\u2019 type.  It has multi-layers of fibrous media and there is retention gradient along with flow direction.  Commonly, large particles are captured first at outer layer and small particles are retained at inner layer.  However, more advanced filter and filtration researches are reported recently.  Nano-fiber based advanced filter to remove large abrasive as well as avoid agglom - eration is reported.  Morby et al.",

For high abrasive content slurry case, abrasive particles are easy to sediment and agglomerate by particle charge interaction.  Along with slurry abrasive development, advanced filter develop - ment and prevention of sediment of abrasive are required in slurry preparation.  7.  Conclusion This chapter reviews abrasives for CMP applications in semiconductor manufacturing.  It includes abrasive types, abrasive synthesis, CMP mechanism and role of abrasives, and oppor - tunities of new abrasive developments.  Semiconductor business increases explosively and various semiconductor structures with high performance have been developed according to market requirement.  In order to achieve mature semiconductor manufacturing, CMP process development is critical and abrasives in slurry play a pivotal role in determining CMP perfor - mances.  The most common abrasive in dielectric CMP is either silica-based or ceria-based one.",
    "For metal CMP (tungsten and copper), silica is the most popular abrasive. and new material CMP. Furthermore, the control of slurry abrasive in the looping is emphasized. Advanced filtration is critical to maintain abrasive size distribu - tion. The applications of CMP are mostly focused on semiconductor industry; however its utilization expands to display industry, M/NEMs, automobile industry and biotechnology. The key of each application is noble abrasive development with proper chemistries.

There has been a growing interest in understanding the fundamental science and technology of CMP, which has continued to lag behind advances in technology.  This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of various chemical and mechanical phenomena such as contact mechanics, lubrication models, chemical reaction that occur between slurry components and films being polished, electrochemical reactions, adsorption behavior and mechanism, temperature effects, and the complex interactions occurring at the wafer interface during polishing.  It also provides important insights into new strategies and novel concepts for next-generation CMP slurries.

Introduction Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is one of the most critical processes to achieve multilevel metallization and incor- poration of gate and channel materials during integrated circuit (IC) fabrication [1, 2].  Applications of CMP can be found in three main areas of IC manufacturing that include forming the transistors (front-end-of-line, FEOL), the local electricalconnections between transistors (middle-of-line, MOL), and the interconnect structures (back-end-of-line, BEOL) [1, 2].  The FEOL process contains all the necessary steps to build the device architecture with a variety of CMP steps for different layer combinations of SiO 2,S i3N4, and poly-Si stop layers, SiC, SiCN, etc.  and the high-k/metal gate structures [3, 4].",

    "transistors.  W and Co have attracted significant attention as an electrically conducting material for local interconnects for the MOL process steps [5].  In the BEOL process steps, all the num- ber of devices are interconnected by sequentially constructing multilevel Cu wires and insulating layers [6].  CMP has been an enabling technology in the FEOL, the MOL, and the BEOL processes by achieving the desired removal rates, selec- tivity, and ultimately planarity with different substrate materi- als.  Each CMP process requires different removal rates, selectivities, and process conditions.  As feature sizes continue to decrease, requiring the fabrication of more complex geome- tries, tunable and selective polishing of different films has become even more critical.  New CMP steps, including new materials and complex structures, are proposed and present even more stringent requirements.  The CMP process has become increasingly sophisticated over the years.  Many of the underlying fundamental mecha- nisms are still not well understood.  Indeed, CMP technology is advancing faster than our understanding of it.",
    "The evolution of high-volume-production CMP processes has its market- driven schedules that are ahead of our understanding of the fundamental principles/technologies.  industrial and academic research.  CMP utilizes a synergistic interplay of chemical and mechanical interactions to achieve the desired removal rates, selectivity, and ultimately planarity with different substrate materials.  During this process, the substrate is pressed down typically onto a grooved polymeric, most commonlypolyurethane pad with controlled hardness and texture under an applied force (Fig.  1).  The polishing slurry is transported into the grooves, pores, and texture of the polyurethane pad by rotating the pad at high speed, which generates the chemical and mechanical actions involving three-body (slurry/polishing pad/wafer) interactions (Fig.  1).  Many factors including CMP consumables and their process/tool conditions can impact the polishing performance.  In this review, I have focused mainly on CMP slurries and their relation to chemical and mechanical aspects of the CMP process.  In general, the slurries for the dielectric CMP process are composed of abrasives, dis- persant, passivation agent for high selectivity, pH adjuster, and deionized water.",
    "In contrast with dielectric materials, metal CMP is governed by the electrochemical behavior of metal films in the presence of oxidizer, complexing agents, and cor- rosion inhibitors. Metal CMP slurries may contain additional chemical reagents like oxidizer, complexing agent, and corro- sion inhibitor. Typical slurry components for dielectric and metal CMP processes are summarized in Table 1. Slurry for- mulations not only are different depending on the materials to be polished but also need to be optimized to meet the strin- gent process requirements [7, 8]. Their characteristics dominate the various interactions that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface. This review presents and discusses the most significant advances with respect to chemical and mechanical phenomena at the wafer interface during CMP.

Also, the final section provides an overview of recently developed real-time in situ techniques to study some of the phenomena that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013 wafer interface during polishing.  Models Based on Contact Mechanics Material removal occurs when there is direct contact between an abrasive particle and wafer surface during polishing.  Models based on contact mechanics were proposed to explain the mechanical aspects of the material removal mechanism.  Assuming that all particles are involved in material removal, their contact area on the particle \u2013wafer surface is given as A\u221dC1/3\u22c5d\u22121/3where Cis the concentration of the abrasive particles and dis the abrasive diameter [9].  However, only abrasive particles larger than the gap between the polishing pad and the wafer surface, termed as \u201cactive \u201dparticles, can con- tribute to material removal (Fig.  1) [10].  Of course, a larger gap will result in less interaction between particles and wafer.",
    "Luo and Dornfeld assumed that only the plastic, but not elastic, deformation caused by the indentation of the active particles into the wafer surface results in material removal.  the material removal rates considering the characteristics of the active abrasive par- ticles (size, size distribution, and concentration), pad hardness, and CMP process conditions [10, 11].  The real contact area (Ar) at the wafer \u2013particle interface considering pad asperities with a Greenwood \u2013Williamson approach was proposed by Lee et al.  [12], which can be expressed as Ar=(fs/C) (Rp/\u03c3p)1/2(PAw/Epw) where Rpis the average radius of curva- ture of pad asperity, \u03c3pis the standard deviation of the pad asperity height, Pis the applied pressure, Awis the nominal area of the wafer surface, Epwis the compose Young \u2019s modulusof the pad and the wafer, fsis the area density of up area of the grooved pad, and Cis a constant in the range of 0. 3 \u20130. 4.  Lee et al.",
    "reported that the real contact area ratio (real contact area/- nominal contact area) continued to decrease over the CMP process, leading to the deterioration in the material removal rates [13].  larger real contact area compared with a random roughness pad [14].  While it is very difficult to observe the in situ movements of active particles during polishing, the contact area of pad \u2013 wafer can be measured and has been considered as the real con- tact area in most cases.  Borucki has developed a tool to measure the real contact area of pad \u2013wafer using the confocal microscopy and analyzed the contact image with digital image processing [15].  Philipossian et al.  investigated the real contact area of a pad with a wafer as a function of the process/tool conditions, pad conditioner, polishing pad, and their combinations [16, 17].  They observed that a higher contact area of pad \u2013wafer results in a higher material removal rate.",
    "Later, Lee measured the real contact area of the polishing pad using a home-built tool as a function of applied pressure and abrasive size and pro- posed a modified semi-empirical model to predict the removal rates of SiO 2films [18].  contact mechanics, when the real contact area between pad and wafer increases, the real contact pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in the material removal rate.  The opposite conclusion may be drawn from the properties of CMP consumables (slurry, films, polishing pad, conditioner, etc. ), their characteristics, and CMP process condi- tions.  More elaborate studies are needed to understand two opposing tendencies of material removal rates.  The classic equation for contact mechanics is Preston \u2019s equation [19] expressed as MRR = KPV where MRR is the material removal rate, Kis Preston \u2019s coefficient, Pis the applied pressure on the wafer surface, and Vis the relative velocity between the wafer and the polishing pad.",
    "Preston \u2019s equation was very useful in explaining most of the removal rates of dielectric materials in the early stages of CMP technology.  [20, 21].  Also, Preston \u2019s equation does not consider the properties of CMP consumables and their characteristics.  As the CMP process becomes more and more complex, it has been difficult to pre- dict CMP results and explain their mechanism by only Preston \u2019s equation.  Today \u2019s contact mechanics for the CMP process not only consider the properties of CMP consumables and their characteristics but also simulate the fluid dynamics and process parameters, which provide more reliable informa- tion on the actual CMP mechanism [20].

    "Despite a number of such investigations, more fundamental studies are needed to investigate the in situ measurement of the real contact area of active particles at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface during polishing, especially while considering SiO 2 and CeO 2abrasive particles that have been typically used for CMP applications.  Most previous models considered particle size and size distribution, where the particle shape was assumed to be spherical.  Their type, hardness, shape, particle agglomer- ation, and chemical reactions between slurry and wafer surface have a significant influence on the material removal rates.  These factors have to be taken into consideration in the math- ematical model based solely on contact mechanics.  Lubrication Models During polishing, CMP slurries are transported to grooved trenches, pores, and texture of a pad and improve hydrody- namic lubrication (Fig.  1).  Sundararajan et al.  proposed a lubri- cation model for slurry flow and a mass transport model for material removal by solving the Reynolds equation [22].  According to their numerical results, a 40 \u201360\u03bcm slurry film between the wafer and the pad is expected at an applied pres- sure of 14 kPa and a linear velocity of 1.",

Lu et al.  developed a dual emis- sion ultraviolet (UV)-enhanced fluorescence technique using a dual-camera imaging system to measure the thickness of the slurry film between the pad and a BK-7 wafer and in situ mon- itored the average slurry film thickness during polishing [23].  Philipossian \u2019s group modified this tool with high spatial resolution images, high-intensity UV laser pulses, and enhanced fluorescence [Fig.  2(a)] [24].  They used two different fluorescent dyes that can be excited at different wavelengths and recorded the fluorescence intensities of the dye molecules in the slurry using two high-resolution cameras.  The intensity ratio of light detected by each camera was converted to slurry film thickness after proper calibration [Fig.  2(a)] [23, 24].  They also studied the dependence of the slurry film thickness on the type of conditioner disk (design, kinematics, and pres- sure) [26] and pad properties (asperities, roughness, and groove) [25].  They measured the in situ coefficient of friction (COF) along with slurry film thickness.",
    "COF showed an inverse relationship with the average slurry film thickness.  with the wafer, resulting in a lower COF.  The high viscosity of CMP slurries not only results in ineffec- tive mass transport of reactants across the wafer and poor lubri- cation between the wafer and the pad but also restricts the movement of abrasive particles in the slurry.  The relationship between COF and the slurry film thickness is well explained by the Stribeck curve [Fig.  2(b)] [27, 28]. By plotting COF against the Hersey number [29], three distinct regions \u2014boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication, and hydro- dynamic lubrication \u2014were identified.  The Hersey number is given by \u03b7V/Pwhere \u03b7is the slurry viscosity, Vis the relative velocity between pad and wafer, and Pis the pressure.  Region I of this curve, known as boundary lubrication, shows relatively very high COF due to the direct contact between two solid sur- faces.",
    "Region II is referred to as mixed lubrication where the wafer does not directly contact a pad because of the slurry film formed between the wafer and the pad.  removal rate and COF.  Mullany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically inves- tigated the effect of slurry film thickness on COF during Si wafer polishing in the mixed lubrication region [30], showing that the removal rates of the Si wafer decrease with increasing Hersey number.  However, the traditional Stribeck curve fails to explain the lubrication phenomena, while COF and downforce fluctuated significantly during polishing because of the so-called stick-slip phenomena [31, 32].  Han et al.  developed a Stribeck+ curve involving instantaneous process valuables [31, 32] (measured shear force and downforce, calculated, and recorded COF), instead of using a constant of shear force and downforce throughout the polishing process, and successfully explained the Stribeck+ curves for SiO 2[31], Cu [32], and W CMP [32] using various combinations of CMP slurries and pads.",
    "As mentioned earlier, viscosity is one of the key parameters that control the slurry film thickness and COF [27, 28].  Newtonian fluids displaying a viscosity that is inde- pendent of shear rate.  However, Lortz et al.  found that the vis- cosity of silica slurries was constant, like Newtonian fluids, only up to a shear rate of 10,000 s\u22121and increased significantly for higher shear rates in the range of 200,000 \u2013300,000 s\u22121[33].  Later, Crawford et al.  developed a new methodology to in situ measure the rheological behavior of CMP slurries ( in situ rheo-polishing setup) while polishing the wafer [34].  They observed a fivefold increase in the viscosity of the silica slurries in the presence of 0. 15 M KCl with increasing shear rate (\u226510,000 s\u22121).  Silica particles can easily form a network structure and agglomerate in an aqueous medium under high shear rates due to their strong hydrogen bonding, triggering a shear-thickening effect [35, 36, 37].  Moreover, in some cases, the heat generated by the chemical and mechanical inter- actions at the wafer \u2013pad\u2013particle interface can have a signifi- cant influence on the slurry viscosity [38].",

    "Chemical Reactions Between Slurries and Dielectric Films The mechanical effect alone is not sufficient to explain the material removal.  Thus, it is essential to understand the chem- ical reactions of slurry components with the wafer surface dur- ing polishing.  Since a glass-polishing model was first developed in the 1980s by Brown et al.  [39], various theories and concepts have been proposed to explain the removal of materials during polishing.  Cook [40] investigated the removal rates of glassusing the slurries composed of various abrasive particles (e. g. , alumina, silica, ceria, zirconia, and titania) and found that the ceria particles can interact with the glass surface by forming the strong chemical bonds, which he called as \u201cchemical-tooth \u201d [Fig.  3(a)] [41].  In the aqueous medium, the glass surface reacts with water molecules and forms dissolved silanol (Si(OH) 4)a s expressed by (SiO 2)x+2 H 2O\u2194 (SiO 2)x-1+ Si(OH) 4[42].  According to his model, OH groups on the ceria surface form strong Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds with silanol groups ( \u2013Si\u2013OH/\u2013 Si\u2013O\u2212) on the glass surface during polishing [Fig.",

The Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds are much stronger than Si \u2013O\u2013Si bonds, which can be removed by both chemical reaction and mechanical abrasion during polishing.  Later, Hoshino et al.  [43] suggested that SiO 2surfaces are removed as the form of lumps of Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds based on Fourier trans- form infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis of the post-CMP slurries [Fig.  3(a)].  Babu \u2019s group studied the effects of the Ce oxidation state (Ce3+/Ce4+) on the ceria surface on the interactions with SiO 2film using UV/visible spectroscopy and proposed that the surface Ce3+sites stabilized by an oxygen vacancy are responsible for the high reactivity with SiO 2film [Fig.  3(a)] [44, 45].  They also showed that the reactivity of ceria particles can be lowered by the blocking of the active Ce3+surface sites using various additives [45, 46].  Based on adsorption isotherms of silicate ions, Seo et al.",
    "reported thatceria particles with higher surface Ce3+concentrations have higher adsorption affinity with SiO 2films. or coating. It is well known that lanthanide (La, Sm, Gd, Nd, and Yb) doping can increase Ce3+concentration at the ceria surface, thus enhancing the SiO 2removal rates [47, 48]. Recently, Kim et al. have devel- oped the core/shell type Ce3+rich ceria abrasive for improved SiO 2removal rates [49]. Additionally, by coating the abrasives with a layer of different materials and chemical compositions, it is possible to change the physicochemical properties of the core abrasives and their reactivity with films [49]. Si3N4films can be easily oxidized to SiO 2at the surface when exposed to water or air, and then removed, as in the case of SiO 2films, by chemical reaction (the formation of Ce\u2013O\u2013Si bonds) as well as mechanical abrasion [50].

    "Figure 3(b) shows the overall hydrolysis of Si 3N4film in an aqueous medium; an amine is liberated from Si 3N4film through nucleophilic attack of water molecules, with the overall reaction described as Si 3N4+6 H 2O\u21923SiO 2+ 4NH 3(\u0394G\u00b0= \u2212147 kcal/mol at 298 K) [51].  The oxidized surface layer may be further hydrated as silicate species, which is written as \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261+H 2O\u2192Si(OH) 4.  Laarz et al.  [41] and Iler [52] showed that the rate of hydration is strongly affected by slurry pH, surface area, the preparation method of film, temperature, etc.  Also, Laarz et al.  found that the oxidized surface layer on Si3N4film behaved like amorphous silica and determined the activation energy (52 kJ/mol) for the hydrolysis of the amor- phous surface layer [41].  The conversion process/reaction of Si3N4film is important in determining the removal mechanism of Si 3N4,and its removal rate [50].  Babu and co-workers inves- tigated various amino acids (alpha, cyclic, and aliphatic) that can be preferentially adsorbed onto Si 3N4film, inhibiting its hydrolysis to SiO 2[53, 54].  The details of the mechanism of Si3N4removal rate suppression will be discussed in detail.",
    "Later, Alety et al.  0. 1 wt% ceria particles + 2. 3 mM Ce(NO 3)3 at pH 4 was \u223c300 nm/min, whereas it is \u223c10 nm/min with only ceria particle [55].  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the polished Si 3N4films is similar to that of an as-received sil- icon oxynitride film which led them to suggest that, in the pres- ence of Ce3+, the surface of Si 3N4film can be converted to silicon oxynitride which was then polished at a high rate [55].  Chemical Reactions Between Slurries and Metal Films Unlike the removal mechanisms of SiO 2and Si 3N4films, metal films (W, Cu, Ru, Ta, and some of their alloys) are very difficult to be polished by only abrasive particles due to their inertness and hardness [1].  Kaufman et al.  first proposed the polishing mechanism of W films when the slurry was composed of fer- ricyanide, hydrogen phosphate, and ethylenediamine [56].",

Paul and co-workers pro- posed chemical kinetics of W [57] and Cu films [58] as a func- tion of oxidizer, chelating agent, inhibitor, and mechanical contribution with a mechanical abrasion process.

M surface, [C] is the concentration of the chemical component C in the slurry and Nais the number of the active abrasive particles per unit area Aof the metal surface.  Later, Paul and Vacassy extended their model to the systems with inhibitor by combin- ing the reaction and kinetics described above [59].  The mech- anism of this process is used to explain other metal CMP processes, and the possible chemical reactions at the metal sur- face are summarized below [60, 61].

These radicals can rapidly form a \u201csoft\u201dpas- sivation layer on the metal film, resulting in high MRR and improved topography of metal film [62, 67].  Chelating agents such as glycine and citric acid that form a complex with metal ions can also help in the material removal by forming either insoluble or soluble surface complexes on the metal sur- face [68, 69].  However, corrosion defects such as pitting, crack- ing, and excessive etching will inevitably occur when the metal films are exposed to corrosive reagents [70].  Organic inhibitors containing heteroatoms such as O, N, and S have been used to inhibit the corrosion of a metal.",

    "The mechanism of the metal CMP process involving the continuous cycles of the formation of a passivating layer on the metal film by oxidizer and inhibitor, removal of the passiv- ating layer by the mechanical action, dissolution by chemical reactions, and re-passivation of the metal film is shown in Fig.  3(c).  Electrochemical Reactions Metal CMP is governed by electrochemical behaviors of metal films in the presence of oxidizer, complexing agents, and cor- rosion inhibitors.  When exposed to slurry components, the metal film is oxidized and loses electron, forming metal cation (anodic reaction, M = M++e\u2212) and the corresponding cathodic reduction reaction receives electrons (O 2+4 H++4 e\u2212=2 H 2O).

The interconnection materials and the barrier materials are in physical contact, and the polishing slurry provides a conductive pathway between them.  According to mixed potential theory, two metals with different potentials are polarized until they reach the same potential, forming a gal- vanic couple.  The more noble metal becomes a cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction, and the less noble metal is corroded more rapidly through dissolution/oxidation while supplying electrons to the cathode, resulting in the preferential dissolu- tion/corrosion of either interconnection material or barrier material by galvanic corrosion (Fig.  4) [73].  Corrosion param- eters ( Ecorr,Icorr,Eg, and Ig) obtained from Tafel extrapolations provide useful information on the oxidation \u2013reduction reac- tions of metal films in the slurry.  Chemical additives induce the shifts in the Ecorrand the Icorrby the complex mechanism.

A downward shift in Tafel plots is observed with the addition of the cathodic inhibitor by retarding the rate of oxygen transfer to the cathodic sites on the metal films.  It is necessary to minimize the potential difference of the metal/barrier couple with low corrosion currents through a careful selection of oxidizer, com- plexing agent, corrosion inhibitor, and the slurry pH.  Cu metal and Ru barrier act as the anode and cathode of the galvanic couple, respectively.  Galvanic corrosion of Cu \u2013Ru couple needs to be controlled through the selective prevention of cathodic reactions on Ru film, and/or increasing the potential of Cu by preferential anodic inhibition of Cu films.  Peethala et al.  [74] proposed a silica-based slurry containing 5 mM BTA and 7 mM ascorbic acid at pH 9 in the presence of KIO 4, as an oxidizer as selective anodic and cathodic corrosion inhibitors for Cu and Ru films, respectively.

This slurry composition was also very effective in the control of the removal rates of Cu, Ru, and low-kdielectric films and their selectivity, but the galvanic cor- rosion of Cu/Ru couple needed to be reduced for improved sur- face quality when Ru is used as the barrier layer.",
    "Adsorption Behavior and Mechanism of Slurry Components on Abrasive Particles and Films Organic compounds such as dispersants and passivation agents in CMP slurries have been used to stabilize the slurry and achieve the selective removal of the materials during polishing, respectively.  CMP slurries are carbox- ylic acids (COOH) and amines (NH 2).  Chemical adsorption between the adsorbate and the surface occurs through various interactions such as electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions [77].  Electrostatic interaction is rele- vant for ionic species and involves the attractive electrostatic forces between opposite charges.  Hydrogen bonding occurs when electronegative atoms such as O, S, or N approach a hydrogen atom bound to another electronegative atom.  It ispossible for organic compounds containing electronegative groups such as \u2013OH, \u2013O\u2013,\u2013NH, and \u2013NH 2to adsorb onto -OH groups of the hydrated surface of particles and films through hydrogen bonding.

PAA coated ceria particles are known to undergo transitions of bridging agglomeration-stable-floccula- tion depending on their physicochemical conditions such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration [81].  Citric acid and PAA have been used to disperse alumina abra- sives [82, 83].  Song et al.  suggested that the mixed dispersant system of citric acid and PAA was very useful for the stable dis- persion of alumina abrasives, leading to higher Cu removal rates by suppressing the hydration of alumina abrasive [84].  Ionic surfactants such as ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) have been used in the formation of ceria slurries reported by Dylla-Spears et al.  [85].  They suggested that the formation of charged micelles above the critical micelle concentration may electro-sterically hinder the agglomeration of ceria particles, which is called the \u201ccharged micelle halo \u201dstabilization mecha- nism [85].

    "Pan et al.  dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic surfactant, could improve the dispersion stability of silica-based slurries for Cu CMP.  Indeed, free SDS surfactants remaining in the slurry were very useful to suppress Cu corrosion and lead to good surface quality.  Polyethylenimine (PEI) and CTAB composed of the amine groups were used to disperse silica abrasive particles also [88, 89].  They can be adsorbed onto the negatively charged silica through electrostatic attractive interaction as well as hydrogen bonding and prevent agglomeration.  However, the adsorbed layer on the particle surface results in the low material removal rate by preventing particles from direct contact with the mate- rials to be polished.  Adsorption Behavior and Mechanism of Passivation Agents on Films PAA, when used as a passivation agent during polishing, can be preferentially adsorbed on the positively charged Si 3N4film (pH IEP\u223c5\u20137) through electrostatic attraction [Fig.  5(a)] [80], suppressing the removal of Si 3N4film and yielding high selec- tivity [90].

Kim et al.  measured the thickness of adsorbed PAA on the Si 3N4film using atomic force microscopy as a function of ionic strength [92].  The thickness of the adsorbed PAA layers on the Si 3N4film was5. 2, 4. 5, and 3. 8 nm with 0, 0. 2, and 0. 4 M KNO 3, respectively.  In some case, if the attractive forces such as hydrogen bonding are more dominant than the electrostatic repulsion between PAA and SiO 2film, it is possible for the adsorption of PAA to occur on the SiO 2film [93].  Park et al.  investigated the effect of adding both PAA and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) to ceria based slurries to achieve the multi-selectivity between SiO 2,S i3N4, and poly-Si films and showed high selectivity ( \u223c65:\u223c15:1 for SiO 2:Si3N4:poly-Si films) in the presence of 0. 05 wt% PAA and 0. 2 wt% PVP in the pH range of 6. 0 \u20136. 5 [94].",
    "Seo et al.  significantly reduced dishing by preventing abrasives from polishing oxide in the trenches [95].  America and Babu [53] proposed that the COOH group of the amino acid proline can form a bidentate interaction with the Si \u2013OH group on Si 3N4film along with H-bonding between the amino acid and Si 3N4film [Fig.  5(b)].  The bidentate bond- ing is observed where two or more hydrogen bonds are formed with a base or base pair.  More generally, many amino acids were able to suppress the removal rates of Si 3N4film through the prevention of the hydrolysis of the Si 3N4as long as there are available in sufficient amounts during polishing.  Since amino acids can also be adsorbed on the abrasive particles, free amino acids remaining in the solution must be of sufficient quantity for effective suppression of Si 3N4film removal rates.  Since these amino acids are sensitive to a change of pH, the slurry pH needs to be optimized based on their pKa values [54, 96].  Hydrophobic interaction involves the adsorption of the nonpolar groups of organic molecules such as a hydrocarbon backbone ( \u2013CH 2\u2212CH 2\u2212) onto hydrophobic surfaces.",
    "Penta et al. showed that these negatively charged surfactants could prefer- entially adsorb on positively charged Si 3N4film viaelectrostatic interactions. A monolayer of anionic surfactants is formed by electrostatic attraction between surfactants and Si 3N4, followed by a secondary layer by hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic tails of anionic surfactants, suppressing Si 3N4 removal rates. Nonionic surfactants that can preferentially adsorb on the hydrophobic poly-Si surface viahydrophobic interaction for preferential removal of SiO 2over poly-Si were studied by Lee et al. [98], and there was a strong dependence of the selectivity on the hydrophilic \u2013lipophilic balance value and molecular weight of nonionic surfactants.

A metal cation can interact with aromatic rings containing conjugated bonds, \u03c0electrons, and lone-pair electrons from heteroatoms (O, N, or S).  The effi- ciency of heteroatoms in the inhibitor molecules increases in the order of O < N < S.  The corrosion inhibition of metal films involves either physisorption or chemisorption of the inhibitor on the metal surface.  Electrostatic attractive force between the charged inhibitor molecules and the charged metal surface leads to physisorption.  Chemisorption is due to the interaction between unshared electron pairs of the hetero- atom and metal atoms to form coordinate covalent bonds.  The standard adsorption free energy ( \u0394G\u00b0ads) can provide insight into the mechanism of corrosion inhibition.  The \u0394G\u00b0adsvalues above \u221220 kJ/mol and below \u221240 kJ/mol correspond to the physisorption and chemisorption process, respectively.  Anodic inhibitors reduce the corrosion potential of metal films by oxidizing a surface layer and forming a thin passivat- ing film on the metal.",

Larger the molecule, higher inhibition efficiency: R 3N>R 2NH > RNH 2, where R is a hydrocarbon chain.  Azole derivatives such as BTA and TAZ have been widely used as corrosion inhibitors for metal films during polishing [Fig.  5(c)] [101, 102, 103].

Although surfactants such as CTAB [106], ammonium dodecyl sulfate [65], and potassium oleate [107] were also investigated as corrosion inhibitors, BTA is the most common corrosion inhibitor used in CMP slurries.  In any case, all these inhibitors can complex with metal ions and remain stable on the metal film as undesirable organic residues [108], and it has been very difficult to remove these organic residues during post-CMP cleaning [109, 110].  So, post-CMP cleaning has become essential to remove these organic residues from the films while minimizing other defects (e. g. , residual particles, foreign materials, scratches, and corrosion).",

Their theoretical results showed that the temperature variation of the wafer, pad, and slurry has an influence on material removal rates.  Indeed, the temperature rise of the CMP process not only has an effect on the slurry viscosity, pH, particle size, and zeta- potential [30, 115, 116] but also leads to delamination or peel- off of the metal films [70, 117].

Also, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases with increasing temperature [125].  For example, 10. 07 mg/L of oxygen can be dissolved in the water at 15 \u00b0C, while 7. 54 mg/L of oxygen can be dissolved in the water at 30 \u00b0C [125].  The change in the dissolved oxygen concentrations can affect the oxidation and dissolution process of metal films and the surface chemistry of abrasive particles as well as their mutual interactions [3].

Since the equation includes the viscosity of the fluid medium (in our case, water) and the temperature, both parameters strongly influence on the hydrodynamic size of particles.

For particles in an aqueous medium, F(\u03baa) is 1. 5 according to the Smoluchowskiapproximation.  The variation of zeta potential of abrasive particles with temperature is explained by the known temperature dependence of the viscosity ( \u03b7) and the relative permittivity ( e) of water.  Evenhuis et al.  reported that experimentally determined values of zeta-potential were directly proportional to the temperature [122].  Kim et al.  also showed an increase in the zeta-potentials of commercial ceria slurries with increasing slurry temperatures [116].

Abrasive particles move far away rapidly from the glass surface by the slurry flow and the platen rotation and sometimes disappear from the field of view, preventing long-term particle tracking in the EW field.  Moreover, the smaller particles, less than 100 nm particles used in the actual CMP system, scatter less light making them more challenging to detect using EW Figure 8: (a) Rheo-polishing setup with plate fixture and 40 mm upper plate, and schematic of the cross-sectional view of the rheometer plate and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) wafer covered with CMP slurry.

Local material removal phenomena were in situ observed by infrared thermography (Table 2) [131].  Frictional heating is responsible for increases in the temperature during polishing.  Data were obtained from an infrared image sensor with the infra- red light collected through a small hole fabricated on the wafer carrier during polishing.  An increase in the temperature is related to material removal efficiency.  The feasibility of the in situ obser- vation of the polishing efficiency was confirmed by the polishing experiment with a polishing pad.  According to Isobe \u2019sp o l i s h i n g model [136], they suggested that the in situ detection of instanta- neous temperature variations depending on Feret \u2019sd i a m e t e r so f the contact area between the pad and the wafer, leading to higher material removal rate [131].",
    "As they mentioned, it is very difficult to directly measure the change in the temperature at the particle \u2013 wafer \u2013pad interface due to the limitation of the proposed method.  interface and remove warm slurry after polishing that passed under the carrier to avoid heat accumulation.  Roy\u2019s group reported an electrochemical measurement cou- pled with a Struers Benchtop Polisher [60].  The top part of the system contains a 1-in diameter coupon wafer as a working electrode embedded in a Teflon holder attached to the polish- ing head.  And the bottom part is a Teflon container attached to the platen.  Electrical connection to the working electrode and the counter electrode was made through carbon brushes pressed against Cu ring surrounding Teflon holder (Top) and Teflon container (bottom), respectively.  The reference electrode equipped with a salt bridge connects to the electrolyte.  This system enables to in situ measure OCP transients and potentio- dynamic polarization for the metal film under controlled tribo- logical conditions.",
    "Roy \u2019s group demonstrated that the tribology and mechanical abrasion affects various catalytic reactions of Cu, Ru, Ta, and Co surfaces during polishing by evaluating CMP systems in the tribo-electrochemical approach [60, 137, 138].  in real-time during polish- ing and can be interpreted immediately.  Moreover, in situ mea- surements can give more representative information of CMP slurry characteristics, including various chemical and mechan- ical actions that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface during polishing when compared with the ex situ analysis of CMP slurries.  However, as stated above, there are still several limita- tions that need to be addressed.  Additional studies and in situ techniques will be helpful to understand the underlying mech- anism taking place during the CMP process.  Challenges and Future Directions (i)Development of CMP slurries for new materials and integration schemes: As the scaling of the devicedimensions runs into physical limitations, 3D integration, 3D NAND technology, and FinFET structure were employed by using new materials and processes [139, 140].",
    "As the architectures have changed from 2D planar to 3D vertical, new CMP steps involving new materials and complex 3D structures were proposed.  a range of tunable polish rates for new materials based on their characteristics such as stoichiometry, surface chemistry, hardness, chemical inertness or sensitivity, and thickness.  A systematic and effective approach needs to be adopted to achieve the necessary high polishing performance, selective polishing, high planarity, low defects, etc.  The research strategies, suggested by the author, for developing next-generation CMP slurries, are summarized in Fig.  9.  (ii)Defect reduction and post-CMP cleaning : Devices at 7 nm node and beyond present even more stringent requirements for the level of acceptable defectivity during the CMP process.  The processes become more defect sensitive and require more expensive metrology techniques with appropriate optical resolution to detect the smaller defects.  CMP-induced defects caused by residual particles, foreign materials, scratches, corrosion, etc.  should be avoided during polishing.",
    "Since this is not always possible, post-CMP cleaning has become a crucial step to eliminate many of these defects [141, 142, 143, 144].  could help remove the particles from the surface [141] but also reported a stability constant-based strategy to study reagents that can remove Cu-BTA and Co-BTA complexes from various surfaces (Cu, Co, TaN, and SiO 2films) [109, 110].  Fundamental understanding of the formation and characterization of various types of CMP-induced defects will immensely benefit the development of next-generation CMP slurries and post-CMP cleaning solutions.  (iii) Development of environmentally friendly CMP slurries: Azoles such as BTA and TAZ are not only poorly biodegradable under wastewater treatment conditions but also lead to watermarks on the wafer surfaces and contamination of various surfaces under CMP conditions.  The effluent wastewater from a semiconductor fabrication plant may contain high concentrations of azoles, etc. , and will be challenging for wastewater treatment processes.  Hence, the chemical additives that effectively passivate metal surfaces and exhibit sufficiently high biodegradation rates need to be considered keeping their environmental impact in mind.

    "(iv) Toxicity issues and safety considerations [145, 146] Toxic gases (e. g. , PH 3, AsH 3) and the As containing waste slurries can be generated during the polishing of III \u2013V materials such as GaAs, InGaAs, InAs, and InP.  Hence, the goal of the polishing of III \u2013V materials should be achieving high planarity without generating toxic by-products.  In the acidic pH, Ru film can be converted to highly volatile RuO 4, a toxic gas.  The addition of complexing agents such as carboxylic acids can help to reduce gas evolution during polishing.  This is an example of tailoring slurry chemistry to minimize the formation of toxic by-products through a careful selection of oxidizer, complexing agent, corrosion inhibitor, and the slurry pH.  Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), a strong organic base, is also one of the materials showing a high level of concern.  TMAH has been widely used as a developer, cleaning agent, pH adjuster, and etchant in the semiconductor industry, but it can cause fatal damage to nerves and muscles in a short period after exposure by contact [147].",
    "Hence, there has been increasing demand to develop less toxic substitutes for TMAH and improve/control the use of TMAH.  and future research directions discussed here were related to CMP slurries and related to chemical and mechanical aspects of the CMP process.  There has been significant progress in understanding the fundamental science and technology of CMP for the past several decades.  Nevertheless, most of the models, methodologies, and tech- niques generally use laboratory-scale model systems under the assumptions about process parameters, which may ormay not be relevant to explain high-volume-production fab- based CMP processes [148].  A close collaboration between aca- demic and industrial R&D will help us to move forward with understanding the fundamental principles and technologies of the actual CMP process by minimizing the gaps between lab- based CMP models and fab-based CMP processes.

    "Changing the calcination temperature to tune the microstructure and polishing properties of ceria octahedrons \u2020 Yongxiu Li,abXueliang Wang,aLinmin Ding,aYao Li,aRucheng Heaand Jing Li *ab Ceria octahedrons with di \ufb00erent microstructure and surface characteristics were prepared by calcining an octahedral CeO 2precursor self-assembled from spherical primary nanocrystals of about 5 nm at 500 \u2013 900/C14C.  Structural characterization revealed that with the calcination temperature increasing from 500 to 700/C14C, the products maintained a hierarchical structure and primary nanocrystals changed from spherical to octahedral particles.  Signi \ufb01cant fusion occurred between the primary nanocrystals and the surface of the octahedrons became smooth at the calcination temperature of 800/C14C.  Single crystal CeO 2octahedrons were formed when the calcination temperature reached 900/C14C.  The change in microstructure induced by elevated calcination temperature led to increased mechanical hardness anddecreased surface chemical activity (speci \ufb01c surface area and surface Ce 3+concentration) of the octahedrons, which had an impact on their polishing performance.",
    "The polishing experiments on K9glass showed that the polishing rate \ufb01rst increased and then decreased with the increment of calcination temperature, indicating that in addition to the mechanical hardness, the surface chemical activity of the octahedrons is also important for material removal.  of chemical activity and mechanical hardness, CeO 2octahedrons calcinated at 700/C14C exhibited the highest polishing rate and the best surface quality for K9 glass.  Introduction Ceria is an important rare earth functional material that is widely used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors,catalysts, ultraviolet absorbents, biological \ue103elds and polishing materials.  1\u20137As a polishing material, ceria has many advan- tages, such as high polishing rate, little damage to the polishedsurface, good surface quality a \ue09der polishing and high removal selectivity, and therefore, has been used as the key abrasive forthe chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of optical glass, advanced integrated circuits and dielectric layers deposited for the fabrication of microelectronic devices.",

    "calcination of carbonate precursor and the results showed that the calcination process with a high oxygen concentration was bene\ue103cial for the synthesis of cubic phase CeO 2with enhanced shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP performance. 23 Although much work has been done on the fabrication of ceria abrasives, there are few studies on the correlations betweencalcination temperature and abrasive morphology, chemicalactivity and mechanical hardness.  Herein, using hierarchicalCeO 2octahedrons as precursor, we synthesized a series of octa- hedral ceria abrasives with di \ufb00erent microstructure and surface characteristics by varying calcination temperature.  The relation-ship between calcination temperature and microstructure,mechanical hardness and chemical activity was establishedthrough polishing experiments on K9 glass.  This work shed a lighton manipulating the mechanical and chemical properties of ceriaabrasives from a microstructural perspective, providing new ideasfor the design and synthesis of ceria polishing materials.  Experimental Preparation Hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor with an average edge length of /C24200 nm was synthesized according to our previous report by a hydrothermal method. 24Typically, 21. 711 g of Ce(NO 3)3$6H2O and 11. 117 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) were dissolved in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water.

A \ue09der washed and dried in an oven at 60/C14C for 12 h, the hierarchical CeO 2 octahedrons were calcined at 500, 600, 700, 800 or 900/C14C in air for 2 h to obtain polishing abrasive (Sample A \u2013E).  Characterization Thermal analysis was performed using a PE PYRIS Diamond TG- DTA in air at a heating rate of 10/C14Cm i n/C01from room tempera- ture to 900/C14C.  The phase and composition of the samples were characterized by X-ray powder di \ufb00raction (XRD, Bruker axs D8 Advance) using Cu K aradiation ( l\u00bc0. 15406 nm).  The morphology and structure were examined by \ue103eld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Quanta-200F micro-scope) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 microscope).  Raman spectra were recorded on a RenishawinVia spectrometer using 532 nm laser excitation.  The BET (Bru-nauer \u2013Emmett \u2013Teller) surface area of the samples was deter- mined by physical adsorption of N 2at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ gas adsorption analyzer.

Polishing tests The slurry was prepared by dispersing ceria abrasive calcined at di\ufb00erent temperature into DI water under stirring and thentreated by ultrasound for 15 min.  The solid content (for abra- sive) of the slurry was 3 wt% and the pH value of the slurry was about 6. 7.  Polishing tests were performed at the K9 optical glasswafers with a diameter of 60 mm by a UNIPOL-802 CMPequipment (Shenyang Kejing Co.  Ltd. ).

The MRR is the average of 3 runs.  The surface topography and root mean square (RMS)roughness were measured by atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon).  Results and discussion The hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor was self-assembled by spherical primary nanocrystals of about 5 nm which sharedan almost common crystallographic orientation (Fig.  S1 \u2020).  The thermal behaviour of the precursor was investigated with TG-DTA.  As illustrated in Fig.  1, the TG curve exhibited contin-uous weight loss in a broad temperature range from roomtemperature to 500 /C14C.  The total weight loss is measured at about 13%.  The weight loss before 200/C14C is ascribed to the removal of free water or adsorbed water and the signi \ue103cant weight loss from 200 to 500/C14C is attributed to the combustion of the residual surfactant PVP.  The DTA curve showed twoexothermic peaks around 254 and 337 /C14C, corresponding to the exothermic behaviour during the thermal decomposition/oxidation of PVP.  Fig.",

As illustrated in Fig.  3a \u2013e, the samples calcined at di\ufb00erent temperatures have octahedral shape with rounded edges and corners.  High-magni \ue103cation SEM images of a single octahedron revealed that they possessed di \ufb00erent surface structures (Fig.  3f \u2013j).  The samples calcined at temperature values of 500, 600 and 700/C14C have a hierarchical structure similar to the precursor and small primary particles can be clearly observed on the surface.  When the calcination temper- ature increased to 800 and 900/C14C, the surface of the calcined products became smooth, indicating that the primary particleswere fused.  More details about the crystallinity and structure of the samples calcined at di \ufb00erent temperatures were studied with TEM, selected area electron di \ufb00raction (SAED) and high- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).

    "4a \u2013c displayed the typical TEM images of a single particle of Sample A \u2013C oriented along the [110] zone axis, showing that they were assembled from small primary particles.  (Fig.  4f \u2013h).  This suggested that the primary particles were assembled into octahedrons with almost thesame crystallographic orientation.  As the calcination tempera-ture was increased to 800 /C14C, the primary particles fused signi\ue103cantly and the elongation of high-order di \ufb00raction spots became inconspicuous (Fig.  4d and i).  When the calcinationtemperature reached 900 /C14C, CeO 2octahedrons with single crystal structure were obtained (Fig.  4e and j).  The HRTEM images (Fig.  4k \u2013o) taken from the white-boxed areas in Fig.  4a \u2013e revealed the evolution of primary particles with the incrementof calcination temperature.  The primary nanocrystals changedfrom spherical-like particles of about 5 nm to sharp octahedralparticles with the edge length of about 8 nm as the calcinationtemperature increased from 500 to 700 /C14C.  With the calcination temperature rising up to 800/C14C, the primary nanocrystals were fused together to form big particles and the boundary between these big particles was not obvious.",
    "As the calcination temper- ature was 900/C14C, the primary nanocrystals were completely fused and the hierarchical structure disappeared, formingsingle crystal CeO 2octahedrons.  This is consistent with the XRD results, i. e. , the increase in calcination temperature led to the increase of crystallinity and grain size.  The Raman spectroscopy technology was also used to investigate the structure of the calcined products.  As shown in Fig.  5, the main Raman band was peaked at about 462. 5, 462. 6, 464. 2, 464. 7, 465. 9 cm/C01for Sample A \u2013E.  It belongs to the only allowed Raman mode (F 2g) of cubic- \ue104uorite-structured CeO 2, which is attributed to the symmetrical stretching mode of Ce \u2013 O8vibrational unit. 25The F 2gmode is very sensitive to the disorder in oxygen sublattice caused by thermal or grain sizedinduced e \ufb00ects.  26\u201328In bulk CeO 2this frequency is 465 \u2013 466 cm/C01.  For the calcined products, we observed a red-shi \ue09dof this main Raman band accompanied by peak broadening as the calcination temperature decreased.  This is attributable to thedecrease of grain size revealed by XRD and TEM.

It can be seen that the speci \ue103c surface area decreased with values at 122. 80, 113. 01 and 75. 96 m 2g/C01with the increasing calcination temperature at 500, 600 and 700/C14C, which is consistent with the increase in the size of primary nanocrystals caused by the elevated calcination temperature. Due to the fusion of primary nanocrystals, the speci \ue103c surface area of products calcined at 800 and 900 /C14C decreased sharply to 34. 24 and 12. 79 m2g/C01.  All the calcined products were positively charged with the surface zeta potential of 116. 6, 79. 2, 77. 2, 75. 0and 40. 2 mV for Sample A \u2013E.  A zeta potential value of 30 mV (positive or negative) can be taken as the arbitrary value thatjudges stability of particle dispersion, so the calcined products have good dispersion stability.",
    "Considering that K9 glass has anelectronegative surface charge (negative zeta potential), oppo-site surface charge will lead to the adhesion of calcined particlesto the K9 surface by electrostatic attraction, which is helpful to improve the removal rate.  rising of calcination tempera-ture, resulting in the broadening of the particle size distribution(Rvalues).  This may be because with the increase of calcination temperature, fusion occurred not only between primary nano-crystals, but also between octahedrons, forming particleagglomerates.  The polishing rate of the calcined products towards K9 glass was also shown in Table 1.  With calcination temperature rising,MRR \ue103rst increased and then decreased.  The products calcined at 700 /C14C was found to possess the highest MRR (187. 9 nm min/C01).  From the mechanical e \ufb00ect during polishing, the increment of calcination temperature increased the grain sizeand made the octahedrons denser, thereby improving themechanical hardness of the octahedral particles, which could explain the increase in MRR from 140. 6 to 187. 9 nm min /C01 when the calcination temperature went up from 500 to 700/C14C.  However, as the calcination temperature continued to rise to800 and 900 /C14C, we observed a decrease in MRR.",

Many studies have shown that the surface Ce oxidation state had a great impact on the polishing performance of CeO 2 particles. 15\u201317,35,36It was believed that CeO 2particle with high surface Ce3+concentration was bene \ue103cial to improve thechemical e \ufb00ect during CMP for the reason that Ce3+sites helped the formation of Ce \u2013OH groups at the CeO 2surface in aqueous medium through H 2O dissociation and facilitated the breaking up of Si \u2013O bond during polishing. 7\u201310,31 \u201334,37 \u201339Therefore, XPS analysis was carried out to investigate the surface Ce oxidationstate of the calcined products.

The concentration of Ce3+ions in Sample A \u2013E was calculated by dividing the area corresponding to Ce3+to the total integrated area of Ce 3d.  As displayed in Table 2, with increasing calcina-tion temperature from 500 to 900 /C14C, the Ce3+concentration decreased from 24. 2 to 20. 5%.  Combined with the speci \ue103c surface area data, it can be concluded that the surface chemicalactivity decreased from Sample A to Sample E.

    "implied that the ratio of Ce4+increased as the calcination temperature rose, which is in accordance with the Ce 3d XPSanalysis.  The decline in chemical activity thus resulted in lower MRR for Sample D and E calcined at 800 and 900 /C14C than for Sample C calcined at 700/C14C.  Surface quality a \ue09der polishing is also crucial to evaluate the CMP e \ufb00ect.  Fig.  8 displayed the surface roughness of the K9 glass wafer before and a \ue09der polished with the calcined prod- ucts.  Results showed that the RMS surface roughness of K9glass in a 20 mm/C220mm area a \ue09der CMP by Sample A \u2013E was 1. 66/C60. 131, 0. 893 /C60. 058, 0. 793 /C60. 066, 0. 877 /C60. 072 and 0. 951 /C60. 065 nm, respectively.  Sample C calcinated at 700 /C14C exhibited the best surface quality a \ue09der polishing.  The K9 surface polished by Sample A has a high surface roughnessalthough the particle size distribution of this sample is narrow,which should be ascribed to the mismatch between chemicalactivity and mechanical hardness of the particles.",
    "The RMSroughness of K9 glass polished by Sample D and E alsoincreased compared to Sample C.  related to the broadening of particlessize distribution.  Although all the calcined products have the quasi-octahedral shape with a similar edge length of 200 nm, their microstruc-ture and physicochemical properties changed due to thedi\ufb00erent calcination temperatures, leading to varied polishing e\ufb00ects.  As illustrated in Fig.  9, the octahedral CeO 2in water is terminated with Ce \u2013OH 2+due to the positive zeta potential while the surface of the K9 wafer is Si \u2013O/C0. 43The opposite surface charge between K9 surface and the calcined octahe-drons leads to a strong electrostatic attraction.  Under certain pressure, Ce \u2013OH 2+on the surface of octahedrons will react with Si\u2013O/C0to form Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds, thus weakening the Si \u2013O\u2013Si bonds on K9 surface layer.  This surface layer activated bychemical reaction is then removed by mechanical friction ofoctahedrons.  The removal of K9 surface layer is achieved underthe synergy of chemical reaction and mechanical friction.",
    "Whenthe calcination temperature is low, the chemical e \ufb00ect of the octahedral particles is stronger than their mechanical e \ufb00ect during polishing, resulting in low MRR and high surface roughness. chemical e \ufb00ect is weak and the mechanical e \ufb00ect domi- nates, which also brings about a decrease in MRR and anincrease in RMS. The octahedral CeO 2obtained at a calcination temperature of 700/C14C has the best matching chemical and mechanical e \ufb00ects, resulting in high MRR and low surface roughness.

The di \ufb00erence in microstructure makes these octahedral CeO 2particles have varied physicochemical properties, resulting in di \ufb00erent polishing e \ufb00ects on K9 glass.  At low calcination temperatures of 500 and 600/C14C, the octa- hedral particles maintained the hierarchical structure of theprecursor, which possessed high chemical activity and lowmechanical hardness.  The primary nanoparticles were fusedtogether and single crystal CeO 2octahedrons were formed at high calcination temperatures of 800 and 900/C14C, which had better mechanical hardness but lower chemical activity.  The octahedral particles calcined at 700/C14C had the best matching of chemical activity and mechanical hardness, thus exhibiting thebest polishing performance toward K9 glass.

    "H.  liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) glass substrates and integrated circuits, because of their excellent physicochemical properties.  Rare earth carbonates, as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, directly affect the morphology of ceria-based abrasives, which, in turn, affects the material removal rate (MRR) and the surface roughness (R a) after polishing.  Herein, rare earth carbonates with different morphologies were obtained by adjusting reaction parameters during precipitation, including \ufb02ake, spindle, and spheroid.  Moreover, the phase of precursors was analyzed, and the evolution process of morphology from precursors to ceria-based abrasives was investigated.  Furthermore, the effect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was explored.  The results show that the primary particles of ceria-based abrasives are near-spherical, but the morphology and dispersion of the secondary particles are obviously inherited from precursors.  Among them, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives prepared by nearly monodisperse near-spherical precursors show better uniformity and higher dispersion, and they not only achieve the lowest R abut also obtain a higher MRR of 555 nm/min (9 wt. %) for polishing TFT-LCD glass substrates.  The result is signi\ufb01cant for the further optimization and application of high-performance ceria-based abrasives.",
    "Keywords: ceria-based abrasives; rare earth precursors; chemical mechanical polishing; TFT-LCD glass substrates 1.  an important CMP-polishing material, which are widely used in polishing glass, the substrate of materials devices, and other silica-containing materials, due to its uniform particle size, moderate hardness, high polishing ef\ufb01ciency, and excellent polishing quality [ 1\u20136].  It has been paid attention to glass substrate polishing because of its greater application prospects.  The TFT-LCD glass substrates are used in the thin \ufb01lm transistor liquid crystal display, which is a key strategic material in the electronic information display industry.  Their surface machining accuracy is directly related to the display panel\u2019s resolution, transmittance, and other key performance indicators [ 7,8].  The TFT-LCD glass substrates are divided by the area in the display industry, and it is generally considered that the 6th generation line and below is the low generation, and the 8. 5 generation line (2200 mm \u00022500 mm) and above is the high generation.  The high generation conforms to the development trend of the future large-screen and multi-screen era, and market demand is increasing.",
    "The high-generation TFT-LCD glass substrate is thin and soft, so the polishing accuracy is extremely strict. area of more than 5.5 m2and a thickness of only a few hundred micrometers. The polished glass substrate is required to have high \ufb02atness and smoothness. Materials 2022 ,15, 7525. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15217525 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials",
    "Materials 2022 ,15, 7525 2 of 11 Furthermore, the requirements for the performance of ceria-based abrasives are getting more stringent, including a higher MRR and an extremely low R a[9].  Ceria-based abrasives and polished substrates polished exhibit chemical and mechanical interactions in the CMP process, and mechanical interactions play a dominant role [ 10\u201312].  The morphology of abrasives is a very important factor in the CMP process.  It can signi\ufb01cantly affect the polishing performance and CMP-induced defects, such as erosion and dishing [ 13].  Therefore, the morphology of ceria-based abrasives needs to be further optimized because of its signi\ufb01cant impact on polishing performance.  Currently, the commonly used preparation method of ceria-based abrasives mainly includes three processes, which are precipitation, \ufb02uorination, and calcination [ 14\u201316].  However, high-precision classi\ufb01cation is adopted to reasonably control the size of ceria- based abrasives [ 17,18].  The morphology and structure of ceria-based abrasives determine their polishing performance, so the in\ufb02uence of different process parameters on ceria- based abrasives has been studied extensively [ 19].",
    "The \ufb02uorination can improve the dispersity of particles and the ceria-based abrasives\u2019 MRR for the glass by introducing the \ufb02uridizer [ 20,21].  of ceria in the polishing process, as well as enhance its polishing performance, and it can form LaOF and LaF 3.  However, LaF 3with low hardness is easily crushed during polishing, which lowers the MRR and shortens the useful life of ceria-based abrasives.  Hydro\ufb02uoric acid (HF) is widely used as a \ufb02uridizer because of its better reaction rate and reaction uniformity, but excessive addition can damage the polished glass surface and increase the R a[22].  In addition, calcination directly impacts phase structures and surface properties of ceria-based abrasives [ 19,23,24].  It was found for the ceria-based abrasives that the MRR increases with the calcination temperature.  In the temperature range of ca. 300\u2013700\u000eC,not only do the physical characteristics of ceria-based abrasives change dramatically, but so do their chemical activities [ 25,26].  However, there are still relatively few studies that demonstrate clear relationships of precursors, ceria-based abrasives, and polishing performance.",
    "Rare earth carbonates are precipitation precursors, which are widely used in the industrial production of ceria-based abrasives.  rare-earth carbonates (RE 2(CO 3)3) [27], hydroxycarbonates (REOHCO 3) [28], oxycarbonate hydrates (RE 2O(CO 3)2\u0001H2O), and di- oxycarbonates (RE 2O2CO 3) (where RE represents a rare-earth ion) [ 29\u201331], which have been studied extensively at the nano- and micro-scale.  In addition, rare earth carbonates with a broad range of morphologies can be obtained by different synthetic methods and experimental conditions, including spherical particles, triangular microplates, nanorods, nanoplates, etc.  [ 32].  The urea homogenous precipitation method was the \ufb01rst technique employed to synthesize monodispersed spherical particles of rare earth carbonates [ 33].  Nanorods and nanoplates of rare earth carbonates can be obtained by altering counter anions [ 34].  Rare earth carbonates as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, their phase structures, and morphologies directly affect the physicochemical characteristics of abrasives and further affect their polishing rate and polishing precision.",
    "However, ordinary ceria- based abrasives are commonly prepared by \ufb02ake-like rare earth carbonates in industrial production, which is the main reason for the low polishing accuracy. abrasives. Rare earth carbonates with different phase structures and morphologies were synthesized by altering conditions during precipitation, where ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4HCO 3) and lanthanum-cerium sulfate mixed liquid ((Ce 0.7, La 0.3)2(SO 4)3\u0001xH2O) were used as raw materials, and La was added to improve the polishing performance of abrasives [ 35,36]. Then, ceria-based abrasives were obtained by \ufb02uorating and calcinating rare earth carbonates with different shapes, and the effect of precursors on the morphology of ceria-based abrasives was studied. Furthermore, the CMP process of ceria-based abrasives prepared by different precursors",

Introduction Ceria is receiving intense attention as a main slurry component for the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process in semiconductor manufacturing industry due to the effective removal rate for oxide \ufb01lm and the softness of the particles [1,2].  Ceria-based slurry has been used in CMP of shallow trench isolation (STI) structures consisting of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride deposition due to its high selectivity over nitride.  For the STI-CMP process, the use of high selectivity slurries is very important to halt the polishing at the nitride stop layer and reduce the amount of defects such as erosion and dishing [3].  During the past decade, structural properties, chemical aspects and morphological characteristics of the ceria abrasives have been identi \ufb01ed as the important parameters that in \ufb02uence the STI-CMP performance [4,5].",
    "Therefore, many approaches to control these properties of ceria abrasives have been extensively investigated.  thermal decomposition of cerium salts such as carbonate and hy- droxide [6].  This method leads to very porous ceria particles with high surface area, inducing softness and high chemical reactivity to oxide \ufb01lms.  However, the size and the shape of ceria abrasives are very limited since particle growth is dif \ufb01cult to control during calcination process.  To achieve the desired particle size and the uniform particle size distribution, mechanical milling and \ufb01lteration is required [7].  Other methods for preparing ceria abrasives are liquid phase pro- cesses [8,9].  These methods can lead to ceria abrasives with desirablemorphological characteristics by manipulating reaction parameters.  However, the size of ceria abrasives is limited to less than 50 nm.  Use of these small size particles results in low removal rates of target layers during CMP.  To overcome these problems, \ufb02ux method is proposed to synthe- size the ceria abrasives with a well-de \ufb01ned morphology.",
    "This method consists of adding precursor in the required ratio to a molten salt mixture, which accelerates the kinetics of the formation of ceria particles [10].  over other methods such as narrow size distribu- tion, desirable characteristics including very \ufb01ne size, high chemical purity and good chemical homogeneity [11].  However, this method has seldom been applied to the synthesis of ceria abrasives for CMP slurry.  Furthermore, the polishing performance of ceria abrasives synthesized using \ufb02ux method has not been reported so far for the silica and silicon nitride \ufb01lms.  In this work, we synthesized the ceria particles of different sizes with uniform particle size distribution using the \ufb02ux method.  For CMP performance evaluation, the effect of ceria abrasives on the removal rate, the oxide-nitride removal selectivity and the within-wafer non uniformity (WIWNU) was investigated.  2.

Results and discussion 3. 1.  Morphological characteristics of ceria abrasives Fig.  2 shows the FESEM images of abrasive particles prepared in different calcination conditions as described in Table 1 .  The primary particle sizes determined using the FESEM micrographs were 84, 166, 295, and 417 nm for slurry A, B, C and D, respectively.  As shown in Fig.  2 , the ceria particles consisted of crystalline grains with a well- de\ufb01ned morphology.",
    "The size of ceria particles increased with the increase in concentration of potassium hydroxide and the calcination temperature.  controlled by changing the calcination conditions, which in \ufb02uence the crystal growth of ceria particles.  Fig.  3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared particles.  As shown in Fig.  3 (a), the characteristic peaks correspond- ing to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes are located at 2\u03b8=28. 51, 33. 06, 47. 48, 56. 20, and 59. 05o, respectively.  They show very close to the ones with cubic \ufb02uorite structure of ceria crystal in JCPDS database.  The sharp intensity peaks were observed for ceria abrasives with larger primary particle size as shown in Fig.  3 (b).  The crystallite size of ceria abrasives was calculated from the Scherrer equation using the line-broadening of the (111) peak in the XRD pattern.  The crystallite size gradually increased from 38 nm to 88 nm as the calcination temperature and the concentration of additive were increased.  This result coincides with the trend of increasing primary particle size in the FESEM images shown in the Fig.  2 .",
    "The synthesis method employed in this study is characterized by a low sintering temperature process, using grain growth accelerator. an accelerator is used to promote the kinetics by enhancing diffusion, due to their low melting temperature.

    "conventional sintering of ceria requires high temperatures leading to partial reduction above 1200 \u00b0C [12], potassium hydroxide/water mixed solvent might offer a liquid phase to promote interdiffusion on contact surface between the smaller particle and the larger ones during the sintering process.  Fig.  4 shows this dependence of the crystallite size on the concentration of potassium hydroxide at a \ufb01xed temperature (850 \u00b0C).  It can be observed that an increase in the crystallite size was seen with addition of KOH at same calcination temperature.  These results indicate that potassium hydroxide strongly affects the growth rate of ceria particles at relatively low temperature.  Therefore, the physical properties and the morphology of ceria abrasives could be controlled by manipulating the concen- tration of potassium hydroxide in this system.  Additionally, cerium dioxide particles obtained by hydrothermal method were used as the precursor in this study, instead of cerium salts such as hydroxide, nitride, and chloride.  Fig.  5 shows the FESEM images of the particles prepared with different cerium precursors.  Compared with other particles as shown in Fig.  5 (a), (b), and (c), it can be observed that the uniformity of ceria particles ( Fig.",
    "5 (d)) prepared using oxide is superior.  is attributed to the fact that in case of cerium dioxide as a precursor, direct grain growth of crystallite is involved during heat treatment.  However, in case of other precursors (hydroxide, nitride and chloride), the formation of cerium dioxide crystallites involves two steps via thermal decomposition followed by grain growth.  Thermal decomposition of such precursors involve series of chemical reactions [13]leading to retarded growth of ceria particles.  Furthermore, it is dif \ufb01cult to achieve uniform ceria particle morphology because of the high surface energy and chemical reactivity of the volatile cerium compounds.  Therefore, it seems that the direct formation to ceria induces the absence of hard aggregates and surface necking in the ceria crystallites. 3. 2.  Characteristics of ceria abrasives before and after CMP To investigate the CMP performance using the synthesized ceria abrasives, we performed polishing test for the four types of slurries with different abrasive size.  Fig.  6 shows the particle size distribution of these slurries without surfactant addition.",

This observation is due to the extensive overlapping of the ceria particles in water-based solution [14].  As shown in Fig.  6 , the increase in the size of the primary particle led to broader particle size distribution in water-based solution.  Fig.  7 shows the FESEM images of ceria abrasives before and after silicon dioxide polishing for slurry C.  The ceria abrasives after polishing were washed with distilled water three times via centrifugation.  According to Fig.  6 , we can con \ufb01rm that the ceria abrasives are brittle and break during polishing process.  This indicates that the ceria abra- sives used in this study are easily broken-down by applied pressure and shear force during polishing.  3. 3.

    "It is clear that the removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lms increased with increas- ing size of ceria abrasives. such as the CMP conditions, morphological characteristics of abrasives and particles size distribution. During the polishing of the oxide \ufb01lm, ceria abrasives exhibit a chemical tooth property which Fig. 2.

    "accelerates the polishing removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm[1]. A sa consequence, the Si \u2013O\u2013Ce bonds can be rapidly removed by the mechanical force generated by pressed pad and abrasives, and this physicochemical reaction lead to the high removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm.  Inthis work, it was found that the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm was essentially dependent on the size of ceria abrasives.  As with the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm increased with increasing in the crystallite size of ceria abrasives.  However, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm is affected by the physical properties of ceria-based slurry systems and the amount of surfactant adsorbed on the \ufb01lm surface [5].  In order to improve the selectivity and uniformity, an anionic acrylic polymer is commonly used to passivate the surface of the nitride \ufb01lm during STI-CMP, which prevents ceria abrasives from contacting the \ufb01lm surface [15].  In this study, the amount of the polymer was maintained constant for all slurry.",
    "Therefore, it seems that the increase in the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm is relate to the mechanical factors rather that to the effect of passivation layer of the polymer absorbed on the\ufb01lm surface.  are in \ufb02uenced by several physical parameters of the CMP process, such as morphological aspects of the abrasives, crystallite size of the abrasives and the CMP conditions.  It is well known that the removal rate increases with increasing particle size due to mechanical indentation.  However, the increase in removal rate shows lower slope between slurry C and D as compared to that from slurry A to C as shown in Fig.  8 .  This led to a transition in removal selectivity between oxide and nitride \ufb01lm at slurry C.  This result is attributed to two related factors: the contact-area reduction and the particle surface activity.  In the case of oxide CMP process, the removal rate is mainly affected by contact area between the abrasives and the \ufb01lm surface.",
    "According to contact-area mechanism [16], the removal rate increases with decreasing abrasive size and increasing solid loading, due to the increase in contact-area between the abrasives and the \ufb01lm surface.  ceria abrasives in slurry decrease as the abrasive size increases.  This implies the decrease in contact area between ceria abrasives in slurry D and oxide \ufb01lm during CMP processing.  Additionally, large abrasives with round-shape lead to the decrease in interfacial contact with \ufb01lm surface, due to their rolling motion [17].  Furthermore, relatively lower removal rate are attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of slurry on the wafer.  For the slurry D, the broader size distribution induces a loss in the frictional occasion of smaller abrasives by bigger abrasives and a local friction interaction of bigger abrasives on the wafer.  The frictional force between the abrasives and the wafer is decreased by using slurry D because the frictional force is directly proportional to the contact area [18].  These polishing behaviors would lead to a relatively lower increase in removal rate for the oxide wafer during CMP.",
    "In this study, such behavior can be clearly seen from the change in oxide removal rate from slurry A to C and slurry C to D.  As shown in Fig.  8 , the removal rate rapidly increased from 1662 \u00c5/min for 84 nm to 3990 \u00c5/min for 295 nm, whereas it slightly increased to 4343 nm for 417 nm in spite of size effect of bigger abrasives during CMP process.  In case of the nitride \ufb01lm CMP, the polishing behavior can be explained by the relationship between additive polymer and abrasive size.  The additive polymer can be more easily attached on the surface of the small abrasives than on the surface of large ones, due to high surface activity and speci \ufb01c surface area of the small abrasives.  The slurry with small abrasives can induce a relatively high removal rate for nitride \ufb01lm, since the passivation layer is insuf \ufb01ciently formed on the nitride \ufb01lm surface as polymer is largely adsorbed on the particle surface.",
    "As described in Table 1 , the speci \ufb01c surface area decreased with increasing abrasive size. thermal analysis. Fig. 9 presents the TGA curves of the ceria abrasives dried from slurry A and D. The TGA curves of the ceria abrasives show two weight losses (curve (a) and (b)). The initial weight loss below the temperature of 100 \u00b0C can be attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed water in the air. The second weight loss observed at 200 \u2013260 \u00b0C is related to the decomposition of the additive polymer adsorbed on the abrasive surface. As shown in Fig. 9 ,\ufb01nal weight loss for two abrasives was different because the additive polymer content adsorbed on Fig. 3.

    "abrasive surface was different. This means that removal rate for nitride \ufb01lms can be relatively increased in spite of decrease in the abrasive size. As a result, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm showed relatively low increase in rate with increase in the abrasive size. Therefore, these polishing behaviors for oxide and nitride \ufb01lms result in the transition of removal selectivity, suggestive of existence of an optimum size of ceria abrasives for high removal selectivity. Additionally, the results for surface uniformity of the oxide \ufb01lms are shown in Fig. 10 . As the size of ceria abrasives increased, the slurry had a higher WIWNU for the oxide \ufb01lm.

    "attributed to a broader particle size distribution of the slurry with large abrasives.  The distribution data in Fig.  6 showed that the slurry has a rather-wide particle size distribution as abrasive particles in- creases.  The broader particle size distribution of large abrasives can cause a different removal rate between the center and the edges of the\ufb01lm surface due to their limited mobility on the wafer surface.  Consequently, the surface uniformity deteriorated with increasing abrasive size during CMP process.  It seems that surface uniformity of oxide \ufb01lm is related to the mechanical factors of ceria abrasives rather that to the morphological factors on the \ufb01lm surface. 4.  Conclusions In this study, we investigated the effects of ceria abrasives on polishing performance during silicon dioxide and silicon nitride CMP.  The ceria abrasives with controllable size were synthesized using the \ufb02ux method.  The size of the ceria abrasives was controlled by changing the calcination conditions without mechanical milling process.  With increasing abrasive size, the removal rate of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride \ufb01lms increased.",
    "On the other hand, the surface uniformity deteriorated after CMP process, due to a wide particle size distribution of the slurry with large abrasives.  a transition behavior at the slurry C (with particle size of 295 nm).  This result indicates that there exists an optimum for removal selectivity as a function of abrasive size in the used slurry system.

The mixture solution of cerium nitrate and urea turned out a visible chemical reaction under the catalysis of ammonia.  The X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicated the colloidal ingredient and nano-crystal structural information.  The colloid was crystalline face-centered cubic nano-structured cerium dioxide.  The sizes of CeO 2colloids are in the range of several nanometers to 10 nm or more.  The application of the hydrosol may focus on the ceria-based polishing agent for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process.  # 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.  All rights reserved.

Especially, CeO 2polishing abrasive for STI-CMP (Shallow Trench Isolation Chemical Mechanical Polishing) has been received widely attention in recent years due to its excellent selectivity and ef\ufb01ciency.  To satisfy polishing requirements, a variety of cerium oxide synthesis methods have been extensively studied to increase cerium dioxide performance in STI-CMP process, such as precipita- tion, sol\u2013gel, hydrothermal, physical chemistry, and high- energy dispersion.  As we known, the commercial abrasive particles are usually prepared by means of calcination, gas combustion or high- energy ball milling dispersion, easily leading to irregular shape, severe agglomeration, uneven distribution of particles.  These disadvantages resulted in the scratches and defects of polished surface, and limited the CeO 2abrasive further application in the decreasing feature size of integrated circuits in the semi- conductor industry. In this paper, we proposed to replace CeO 2-calcinated abrasive with CeO 2-colloid abrasive in order to reduce polishing defects.  Otherwise, the synthesized colloids should be crystalline ceria to keep its high polishing selectivity.",

The details were described as follows (Fig. 1): cerium source Ce(NO 3)3/C16H2O, buffer CO(NH 2)2and dispersant PVP were dissolved into a certain amount of deionized water with a magnetic stirrer. The temperature of the mixture solution gradually increased from room temperature to the set temperature, and the solution should be kept stirring for 1 h. Then, an appropriate amount of ammonia was added dropwise with a burette. The reaction quickly happened within a few seconds, and the solution color underwent obviously change in few hours. The phenomenon of color change was believed to be correlated with the chemical changes. As the color of reaction solution turned from purple into pale yellow, the Ce3+happened to be oxidized into Ce4+by O2under air atmosphere.

    "was due to the removal of physisorbed water.  Decomposition of the structural water was in between 140 8C and 215 8C.  The weight loss from 215 8C to 305 8C was attributed to the decomposition of a side product of cerium oxycarbonate [7], corresponding to a sharp exothermic peak at 291 8C in the DTA curve.  The exothermic peak around 450 8C might be caused by the oxidation of cerium compound.  So, it could be concluded that the synthesized product contained not only ceria but also some other materials.  As we know, the crystal structure of pure ceria is a face- centered cubic structure, grouped into the calcium \ufb02uoride (CaF 2) structural type with space group Fm3m.  The XRD pattern of the dried ceria colloids (Fig.  3) showed a good agreement with literature data (JCPDS No.  34-0394).  The main Bragg peaks with Miller indices (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), and (4 0 0) could be found clearly.  The pure crystallized ceria could be obtained at lower temperature.  Fig.  4 depicts the XPS spectrum of the CeO 2nanoparticles.",
    "Peaks of Ce 3d and O 1s proved the existence of cerium oxide.  Ce 3d binding energy (BE) peaks were consistent with that of Ce4+ions.  The band at 918. 1 eV should be one of the 3d104f0 state of the Ce4+ions [10,11] , compared with the band of 916. 5 eV BE in the reference [12], the upward shift of binding energy value may be due to smaller particle size.  Here, the software of XPSPEAK41 was used to mark and \ufb01t the Ce 3d peaks. The aqueous solution with concentration of 0. 1 mol L/C01 cerium was adopted for synthesis of ceria colloids.  The content of PVP was 30 g L/C01.  The TEM images of ceria colloids synthesized at different temperatures for 72 h are shown in Fig.  5.  Obviously, the sample synthesized at 25 8C had severe colloid agglomeration (Fig.  5(a)).  However, the sample synthesized at 65 8C (Fig.  5(b)) indicated a better dispersing behavior.  Lower temperature might restrain the dispersion effect of PVP so that leaded to a bad dispersion performance.  It means that the dispersion effect of PVP requires a proper temperature.",
    "Generally, the content of ceria colloids in the solution depends on the concentration of cerium salt in reaction precursor. In the study, the samples with different cerium contents were synthesized to con\ufb01rm the limit concentration of ceria hydrosol. The experimental results shown: with increas- ing concentration of cerium salt in the solution, the precipitation started to appear gradually. When the concentra- tion of cerium reached up to 0.2 mol L/C01, the colloids in thesolution could not keep its suspension state and formed precipitation totally. Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of two kinds of cerium concentration samples. It could be found that each colloid was consisted of several 10-nm-size crystal particles, and ceria colloids were not monodispersed actually. The CeO 2 colloids obtained from the solution of 0.05 mol L/C01cerium (a) possessed a better dispersion performance than that of Fig. 7.

    "0. 1 mol L/C01cerium (b).  The experimental facts indicated the stability of ceria hydrosol is relative to the concentration of cerium salt.  Fig.  7(a)\u2013(c) shows TEM images of the samples prepared at different reaction times.  It could be seen that the effect of reaction time on crystallinity of ceria is obvious.  With increase of reaction time, the reciprocal lattice of patterns became more and more evident, which proved a well-crystallized ceria.  Size of the ceria colloids not changed obviously with increase of reaction time.  Ceria particles are easy to form aggregation.  To verify the stability of cerium oxide hydrosol, the sample stored three months was measured by TEM.  The colloids had no signi\ufb01cant further agglomeration compared with fresh sample (similar to Fig.  7).  The hydrosol is stable enough for application.  4.  Conclusions Well-dispersed ceria hydrosol was obtained via the sol\u2013gel process at 65 8C.  The ceria colloids possessed face-centered cubic CaF 2structure.  The grain size is in the range of several nanometers to more than 10 nm.  The hydrosol also exhibited a good aging stability in three months.  References [1] S.  Salomons, R. E.  Hayes, M.

Introduction CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing)1is a key technology in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. 2It mainly re- lies on chemical and mechanical synergy to realize the material's global \ufb02attening. 3With the development of semiconductor process nodes, CMP technology has become more and more important and has become an indispensable planarization process for processes below 0.",
    "35 mm.  CMP system are the main consumables, and the polishing slurry as an active material can signi \ufb01cantly affect the polishing performance. Ceria is considered to be the most effective abrasive for polishing SiO 2substrates due to their unique physical and chemical proper- ties.  With the increase in the number and density of multilayer wiring, the circle of CMP process steps has increased signi \ufb01cantly, and the impact on the yield of subsequent processes has become greater and greater.  Therefore, it is a hot research topic to enhance the polishing ef \ufb01ciency by improving the chemical activity of the abrasive itself rather than increasing the polishing pressure (Higher downforce results in worse surface quality after CMP5).  The \u201cchemical tooth \u201dtheory proposed by Cook6contributed to the study of the polishing mechanism of ceria-based abrasives.  The formation and destruction of the Ce eOeSi bond between CeO 2 abrasives and SiO 2substrate is the key to realizing material removal.  The role of Ce3\u00fein CeO 2abrasives in enhancing this re- action has been widely recognized by researchers.  Srinivasan et al. 7 discovered that Ce3\u00feon the surface of CeO 2abrasives is the key to achieving the removal of SiO 2materials.",

    "polishing rate due to the higher Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface.  Therefore, the defects on the ceria surface can enhance the chemical activity of the abrasive, which improves the polishing performance.  Doping is a common way to enhance the chemical activity of nanoceria.  Younis et al. 9showed that Gd3\u00fedoping enhanced the degradation performance of CeO 2particles on organic dyes, and the enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of surface defects on CeO 2induced by ion doping.  Cheng et al. 10improved the polishing ef \ufb01ciency of CeO 2abrasives by modifying the surface of commercial particles by ion doping.  Furthermore, Kim et al. 11directly synthesized La3\u00feand Nd3\u00fedoped nano-ceria by a traditional hydrothermal method and con \ufb01rmed the signi \ufb01cant effect of doped abrasives on enhancing CMP per- formance for SiO 2substrates.  These results are attributed to the increased Ce3\u00feconcentration on the CeO 2abrasive surface by ion doping.

Through detailed characterization studies, the evolution of crystal structure and micro-morphological of CeO 2abrasives were analyzed.  Although the effect of Ce3\u00fein CeO 2abrasives on polishing performance has been con \ufb01rmed, the relationship between the atmospheric environment and the formation of Ce3\u00feon the abra- sive surface remains to be further elucidated.  In this work, the in- \ufb02uence of reducing atmosphere on the concentration of Ce3\u00feon the abrasive surface was emphatically investigated.  Moreover, the polishing performance of CeO 2abrasives prepared in reducing at- mosphere and air were compared, and the role of the prepared CeO 2abrasives on the removal ef \ufb01ciency of SiO 2substrate was investigated.  Finally, the polishing mechanism of the CeO 2abra- sives was discussed through the comprehensive analysis of the morphology, defect characteristics, and polishing performance of the abrasives.

In this work, the abrasives prepared under air, Ar, and Ar/H 2at- mospheres were named CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2, respectively.  2. 3.

Results and discussion 3. 1.  Morphology and structure characterization of CeO 2abrasives The XRD patterns of the prepared CeO 2particles are recorded in Fig.  1 .  All diffraction peaks of the samples match well with the CeO 2 phase of face-centered cubic (fcc) \ufb02uorite (JCPDS 34 e0394), and no other cerium oxides (Ce 2O3species) are found.  The peak position analysis of each diffraction spectrum showed that the crystalstructure of CeO 2prepared under different atmospheres changed.  The magni \ufb01cation of the diffraction peaks shows that the diffrac- tion peak positions of the samples synthesized under Ar and Ar/H 2 atmospheres are shifted to a higher angle, which may be due to thelattice contraction caused by more oxygen vacancies.  The Rietveld re\ufb01nement of CeO 2samples was characterized using the GSAS program to further con \ufb01rm subtle changes in the structure of CeO 2 particles, as shown in Figs.  S1(a ec).",

For all samples, the re \ufb01nement parameters ( Rp<7%, Rwp<9%, and Chi2<2) are within a accepted range, indicating that the results of re \ufb01nement are credible.  The results show that the lattice constants and volume of CeO 2-Ar (0. 54132 nm, 0. 15862 nm3) and CeO 2-Ar/H 2(0. 54130 nm, 0. 15860 nm3) are smaller than CeO 2-Air (0. 54137 nm, 0. 15867 nm3).  This further con \ufb01rms the formation of oxygen vacancies in the CeO 2crystal.  The oxygen vacancies promote the conversion of Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00fefor unit cell charge bal- ance,17which is responsible for the increase in Ce3\u00feconcentration in CeO 2. 18,19 The FT-IR spectra of the abrasives are shown in Fig.  2 .

The bands located at 2160 and 2028 cm/C01 are due to the stretching vibration of C eH, and CH 2groups, asso- ciated with some of the organic moieties which get physically adsorbed on the surface during sample preparation and handling. 21 The peaks between 1047 and 1630 cm/C01correspond to the Ce eO stretching vibrations attributed to the hydrogenated CeO 2sam- ple. 20,21The enhancement of the vibrational peak with the reducing atmosphere indicates that the sensitivity of CeO 2abrasives to hy- droxyl groups is elevated, which favors the adsorption of abrasives to SiO 2substrates.  Meanwhile, the existence of the peak at 716 cm/C01in the IR spectra is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibrations between O eCeeO atoms. 23,24Furthermore, it veri\ufb01es the bonding of metal eoxygen existing in the CeO 2lattice, which is consistent with the XRD results.

    "MRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is improved by 19. 45% compared with CeO 2-Ar abrasives, which may be attributed to the octahedral morphology that enhances mechanical interaction during CMP.  In addition, we collected the values of MRR for different types of CeO 2- based abrasives in some works, as shown in Fig.  S4 .  For the core/ shell abrasives, the present results show a poor MRR, although the structure of the abrasive has been designed and regulated to improve CMP performance, it is still far from being suitable for large-scale commercial use.  For the doped abrasives, it is believed that the doping increases the Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface, which enhances the MRR.  However, impurity ions of the abrasives during the polishing will pollute the surface of the sub- strate leading to dif \ufb01culties in CMP cleaning, and residual impurity ions will negatively affect or even damage the device.",

The sharped morphology reduced contact areas between abrasives and surfaces, which leads to enhanced contact stress reducing the surface quality. 38As shown in Fig.  7 (e), the pro \ufb01le roughness in the selected area (the diagonal in Fig.  7 (aed)) was also analyzed, where the Z-axis represents the depth of the line pro \ufb01le, and the X-axis represents the length.

There may be a positive function between the Ce3\u00feconcentration and MRR, which may be due to the electron transfer of Ce3\u00fepromoting Ce eOeSi bond breaking.

    "Fig.  8 is a schematic diagram of the polishing mechanism of CeO 2abrasives prepared under different atmospheres on the SiO 2 substrate.  The synergy of chemistry and mechanics in the CMPprocess is what makes the material surface \ufb02at.  The CeO 2abrasives not only have moderate mechanical properties but also provide chemical activity in the CMP process.  As shown in Fig.  8 (a), the CeO 2abrasives with nearly spherical morphology were prepared under air, and the contact stress is small under the downforce, which only removes the super \ufb01cial atoms on the surface.  The spherical particles may have both sliding and rolling removal be- haviors on SiO 2substrates.  The sliding friction behavior of abrasives is considered to be the main mode of material removal, while the rolling behavior of some abrasives weakens the material removal ability due to reduced friction.  As shown in Fig.  8 (b), the CeO 2 abrasives with octahedral morphology were prepared under a reducing atmosphere.",

The abrasives with octahedral morphology achieved the same indentation depth as spherical particles under lower compressive stress, which veri \ufb01es that the abrasives with octahedral morphology have a higher MRR.  The chemical activity of the CeO 2abrasives is an advantage that distinguishes it from other abrasives, which signi \ufb01cantly enhances the CMP performance of the abrasives.  As shown in Fig.  8 (c), the CeO 2abrasives reacted with the SiO 2substrate to form Ce eOeSi bonds in the slurry, the offset of the electron cloud strengthens the CeeOeSi bonds and weakens the Si eOeSi bonds, then the surface layer of the substrate is removed by abrasives under the mechanical force.

    "8 (d), Ce4\u00feon the surface of the CeO 2abra- sives is reduced to Ce3\u00fewith higher reactivity under the reducing atmosphere. eOeSi bond is formed between the abrasives and the substrate surface, the free electrons in Ce3\u00febreak the Si eOeSi bond through electron transfer, which signi \ufb01cantly increases the material removal ef \ufb01ciency. In the CMP, the hydrated surface layer (Si(OH) 4) is removed by the tribochemical reaction or/and mechanical force of the Fig. 8.

    "abrasives. 39The material removal is closely related to the frictional effect of the two/three-body contact at the interface.  In previous work,40,41we indirectly used the CeO 2tip to study its frictional behavior.  It is believed that studying the friction behavior of abra- sives with different properties at the interface is the key to quan- titatively analyzing the relationship between abrasives and MRR.  In the next work, we will study the CMP behavior of CeO 2abrasives under multi-factors through a series of experiments and FEA.  4.  Conclusions CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives with different surface defect concentrations were prepared by reducing atmosphere-assisted molten salt method, which were used for CMP of SiO 2substrates.  XRD and Rietveld re \ufb01nement con \ufb01rm that the CeO 2lattice shrinks due to the formation of oxygen vacancies with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere.  SEM images observe that the morphology of the abrasive prepared under a reducing atmosphere gradually changes from spherical to octahedral.  The analysis of XPS patterns con \ufb01rms the higher concentration of de- fects on the surface of the abrasives prepared under a reducing atmosphere.",
    "CMP experiments on SiO 2substrates indicate that the prepared abrasives all signi \ufb01cantly improve the surface quality.  Obviously, CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have very strong polishing ef \ufb01ciency (578. 74 and 691. 28 nm/min), with MRR in- creases of 71. 43% and 104. 76%, respectively, compared to CeO 2-Air abrasives.  The enhanced polishing ef \ufb01ciency can be attributed to the elevated chemical activity (Ce3\u00feconcentration) of the CeO 2 abrasives prepared under the reducing atmosphere, which en- hances the chemisorption and bonding between the CeO 2abrasives and the SiO 2surface.  The morphology of the abrasives further af- fects the MRR, where the sharp edges of the abrasives enhance the frictional behavior of the interface, thereby accelerating material removal.  In this work, the CeO 2abrasive prepared in a reducing atmosphere has the advantages of high-speed polishing and improved surface quality, which can signi \ufb01cantly improve the CMP performance.

Introduction Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) processes are being uti- lized to achieve global planarization of substrates with surface coatings of varying thickness ranging from nanometres to several micrometres, with desired selectivity and minimum defects [1\u20133] .",
    "Initially, CMP was majorly used for planarization of silicon sub- strates but has also subsequently found application in polishing semiconductors, metals and polymer surfaces for technologies like integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) [2].  In CMP, both chemical and mechanical prop- erties of the abrasive particles play a crucial role in achieving high polishing rates.  The chemical nature, size and shape of the abrasive particles used in polishing slurry play a crucial role in achieving the desired CMP results.  Silica particles have been used extensively as an abrasive in polishing industry.  Recently ceria has also been used as an abrasive because of its high chemical selectivity, in compari- son to silica [4\u20136] .  \u2217Corresponding author.  E-mail address: pbhargava@iitb. ac. in (P.  Bhargava). Employment of technologies like shallow trench isolation (STI), which isolates neighbouring semiconductor devices in an IC cir- cuit, critically depends on the planarization capacity of CMP process [15,16] .  In STI the CMP process is used to polish off the SiO 2dielec- tric layer, down to the underlying nitride, and stops at the nitride layer.",
    "STI heavily depends on CMP for selective removal of SiO 2 over SiN layer. to oxide with respect to the nitride, and should leave the surface, planar and defect-free [5]. Cook et al. estimated that one SiO 2molecule is removed for every twenty-four collisions between ceria abrasive and silica substrate compare to 500 million collisions required in the case of silica abrasive. Ceria slurries, selective pol- ishing of silicon oxide over silicon nitride \ufb01lms and higher removal rates is explained based on ceria\u2019s inherently superior chemical selectivity and higher polishing rates, compared to silica abrasive particles [5,6,17\u201319] . In CMP, mono-dispersity and morphology of abrasive particles are identi\ufb01ed as important factors which affect the polishing rates [5\u201311,14] . Some of the signi\ufb01cant and cost effective methods for synthesis of abrasive particles including ceria are solvo-thermal method, sol\u2013gel method, self-assembly, electrochemical method and micro-emulsion method [4]. However, mono-dispersity and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.09.149 0169-4332/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Ceria coated silica nanoparticle structures are identi\ufb01ed as a successful approach for controlling the size and morphology of ceria abrasive particles [8,20\u201324] .  In this study we investigate synthesis of less than 100 nm pseudo ceria particles by undertaking coating of \ufb01ne ceria particles over coarser silica.  Synthesis of ceria coated silica nanoparticle enables modulating selectivity of the CMP process to tap into potential Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) market [25,26] .  The presently available/reported lit- erature and information, on properties of ceria in CMP is minimal.  This paper demonstrates the synthesis and study of various param- eters in\ufb02uencing the formation of ceria coated silica nanoparticles of size less than 100 nm.  CMP abrasive slurries prepared using syn- thesized ceria coated silica nanoparticles were used for studying SiO 2:SiN polishing selectivity.  2.  Experimental 2.",

In Stober process, silicon alkoxides are hydrolysed to silanols, which further undergoes con- densation reaction to form silica nanoparticles.  There are various modi\ufb01cations of this method reported in the literature [27,28] .  Both sol\u2013gel and microemulsion routes were used to synthesize mono-dispersed and spherical silica nanoparticles of size less than 100 nm.  It was observed that for particles less than 100 nm, using sol\u2013gel method, it was dif\ufb01cult to control size and shape of the silica nano particles.  The resulting nanoparticles were highly agglomer- ated with necking between the individual nanoparticles as shown in Fig.  1(a) and (c).  On the other hand, using microemulsion methodthe particle size and shape were controllable.  The well separated nanoparticles are shown in Fig.  1(b) and (d).  In microemulsion method, the surfactant molecules dissolved in organic solvents forming spherical micelles.  Silica nanoparticles are grown, inside these micellar micro-cavities, by controlled addition of silicon alkoxides and catalyst [29,30] .  Fig.",

Addition of a co-surfactant further stabilizes the microemulsion system as it bridges the oil and water interface.  25% NH 4OH was used as a catalyst for the reaction.  For the syn- thesis, DI water and ammonia was added to a mixture of Triton X-100 and cyclohexane in hexanol under sonication followed by drop wise addition of TEOS.  The reactants were mixed for 24 h dur- ing which TEOS was hydrolysed by NH 4OH to obtain silica particles.  The use of surfactant helps in stabilizing the emulsion and controls the morphology of the silica particles formed.  Upon completion of reaction, ethanol was added to the reaction mixture to break the micro-emulsion and release silica nanoparticles.  Further these SiO 2nanoparticles were separated using centrifugation method.  Collected particles were washed twice with ethanol and DI water.  These particles were heated at 250\u25e6C for 4 h to remove the surfac- tant molecules from the surface before they were further used for ceria coating.  2.",

    "Polishing experiments Polishing tests were carried out on Ecomet 4+ Automet pol- ishing machine manufactured by Buehler using groove pads made of polyurethane.  slurry \ufb02ow rate of 100 ml/min was maintained.  The polishing slurries were prepared by dispersing silica nanoparticles, ceria nanopar- ticles and ceria coated silica nanoparticles separately in aqueous medium with additives and was mixed on a roller miller.  Film thickness reduction of polished Si wafers was determined using an optical ellipsometer (JOBIN-YVON SPEX).  Structural analysis of the ceria coated silica nanoparticles was carried out using TEM (Philips CM 200 keV) and it was compared to particles used in prepara- tion of commercial slurries.  X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Bruker D8-advance, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to carry out the phase analysis of the nanoparticles.

During precipitation reaction of ceria on silica particles, pH and temperatures was varied, to obtain different extents of ceria coat- ing on silica.  The precipitation of ceria from cerium nitrate depends on the reaction pH.  Beyond pH 6, the nitrates undergo an exchange reaction with hydroxyl ion as shown in Eq.  (1).  pH of the precipi- tation reaction was controlled, by varying the amount of NH 4OH, and it was observed that at a lower, acidic pH (3\u20135), ceria forms a partial coating on silica at room temperature as shown in Fig.  3(a).  For acidic pH, increasing the reaction temperature from room tem- perature to 95\u25e6C also resulted in partial coating of ceria on silica particles as in Fig.",

Polishing of SiO 2and SiN wafers Polishing experiments were carried out on thermally grown silicon oxide and nitride \ufb01lms on silicon wafers (Noel Technolo- gies, Campbell, CA) and were polished on a Buehler Phoenix-beta polisher using IC-1400K Groove pads made of polyurethane (Rodel Inc. , Phoenix, AZ).  Before each experiment, the polishing pad was conditioned for 1 min with a diamond grit conditioner using de- ionized water.  The aqueous polishing slurry (1 wt%) was sonicated for 30 min and was placed on a roller miller to maintain good dispersion.  The pH of slurry before polishing was measured and maintained at pH-5 at which the silicon oxide wafer and the ceria particles will be oppositely charged and thus improving interac- tion between wafers and particles.  For pH > 5 the particle settling rate was found to be higher and ceria coated silica slurry was found to be unstable at basic pH.",
    "This observation is similar to that of bare ceria particle slurry showing increased particle agglomeration and reduced removal rates and stability for ceria slurry at basic pH (pH > 7) [1,11] .  SiN wafers were determined from the differences of the \ufb01lm thicknesses measured by ellipsome- try technique [13] .  Selective polishing ratio of 12 was observed for SiO 2:SiN wafers using ceria coated silica particles prepared under different conditions.  The polishing mechanism is explained as fol- lows.  When ceria abrasive particles come in contact with the silica surface, a chemical bond forms between the ceria particle and sil- ica surface as shown in Eq.  (2).  Further, strained Ce\u2013O\u2013Si bond ruptures at the weaker Si\u2013O bond due to the mechanical motion during CMP and is removed as silicic acid (Si(OH) 4) in aqueous slurry.

This is indicated by almost no change in XRD peaks and structure observed under TEM as shown in Fig.  8.",
    "Fig.  respec- tively shows ceria coated silica prepared at pH 4. 5 before and after polishing.  It was observed that for particles prepared at pH 4. 5, ceria coating was removed from the silica surface after the polish- ing experiment.  Whereas ceria coated silica nanoparticles prepared at pH 10 before polishing as shown in Fig.  8(c) and after polish- ing as shown in Fig.  8(d) show better adherence of ceria on silica core.  4.  Conclusions This study demonstrates synthesis of highly spherical and mono-dispersed, ceria coated silica nanoparticles for application as abrasive particles in selective CMP.  Coating of ceria over sil- ica was done using precipitation method.  Precipitation reactions were carried out by varying the pH and reaction temperature.  A uniform and adherent coating of ceria over silica was obtained for reaction carried out at 95\u25e6C at pH 10.  Coating of ceria over sil- ica and dispersion properties were studied using TEM, EDX, XRD and zeta-potential analyses, and the results show formation of stable and dispersed ceria coated silica nanoparticles of size less than 100 nm.",
    "These uniform and spherical nanoparticles structures are excellent substitutes for coarser ceria abrasive particles.  100 nm nanoparticles particles considerably reduce the solid load- ing in the formulated CMP slurry.  Polishing results achieved so far shows improvement in selectivity between SiO 2and SiN wafers using 1 wt% nanoparticles particle slurry with maximum selective removal rate of 12.

    "Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)11 J.  Seo, U.  Paik Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea 11. 1 Introduction Since chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) was developed in the 1980s at IBM, it has played a key role for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing ( Beyer, 1999 ).  In the IC fabrication process, front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) processeshave been crucial applications of CMP ( Krishnan et al. , 2009 ).  FEOL CMP is the pro- cess that forms the shallow trench isolation (STI) by polishing the gap- \ufb01lling materials such as SiO 2.  BEOL CMP is used to form metal interconnects including Al, W, and Cu.  In general, CMP slurries are composed of abrasive, oxidizer, organic compounds such as dispersant and passivation agent, and deionized water (DIW).  Speci \ufb01c slurry formulations are different depending on the materials to be polished.  The physico-chemical properties of slurry that have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performances are determined by the complex interactions between its components.  As the designrule is reduced, the demands on CMP performance have become more stringent. Thus, understanding the physicochemical properties of slurry is essential to developCMP slurries for next-generation devices including new materials and complexstructures.",
    "11. for CMP The CMP process can be divided into interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP, STI CMP, andmetal (W, Cu, and Al) CMP. ILD CMP is a process that polishes dielectric materialssuch as SiO 2deposited between metal interconnects. Slurries are composed of abra- sive, dispersant, and other additives. STI CMP is a process that uniformly polishesthe step height of SiO 2, formed by the gap- \ufb01lling process, and stop on stopping layer such as the Si 3N4or poly-silicon (poly-Si) \ufb01lm. There are requirements on the high polish rate selectivity between SiO 2and stopping materials to prevent their erosion. For this reason, slurries for STI CMP contain passivation agents for high selectivity. Contrary to ILD and STI CMP, metal \ufb01lms are hard to remove using abrasives because of their inertness. Thus, metal CMP slurries need suitable oxidizers to forman oxidation layer on the surface that can be easily removed by abrasives.

    "To formulate these slurries that are suitable for each CMP process, it is very impor- tant to understand the role and characteristics of each component in slurries.  In this sec-tion, we will discuss the role and characteristics of each component for CMPperformances in detail.  11. 2. 1 Abrasive particles Abrasive particles are one of the main components in CMP slurry.  Silica, ceria,alumina, and other materials have been used as abrasives.  Silica abrasives have beenwidely used for ILD, STI CMP, and metal CMP.  There are two types of silica abra-sives: fumed and colloidal silica.  Figure 11. 1 shows their transmission electron micro- scopy (TEM) images ( Zhang et al. , 2012 ).  Fumed silica, made from \ufb02ame pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl 4\u00fe2H2O/SiO 2\u00fe4HCl), has been used as an abrasive because of its inexpensive price, high purity, and simple synthesis.  However, it formsa network structure in an aqueous media caused by weak hydrogen bonding, resulting in agglomeration.  Thus, subsequent processes such as micro \ufb02uidizer treatment and \ufb01ltration process are essential to formulate CMP slurries using fumed silica.",
    "Contrary to fumed silica, colloidal silica can be made with the desired particle size and uniformsize distribution through hydrolysis of metal organic precursors (by the net reactionhSieOH\u00feHOeSih4hSieOeSih). acid sodium and organic silicate are used as precursors to prepare colloidal silica. Colloidal silica, made from silicicacid sodium, inevitably contains large amounts of sodium ions, which can cause severeproblems such as damage on the gate oxides of a device. In order to use it, the ion- exchange process is required to remove sodium ions. Organic silicate can produce high purity silica compared with silicic acid sodium, and be used as an abrasive forpolishing after the washing and decant process to remove residual precursors. Thedemands on defect become more stringent with a decrease in device dimensions.Thus, fumed silica has recently been replaced by colloidal silica in CMP processesthat require high surface quality of polished \ufb01lm. 50 nm 50 nm(a) (b) Figure 11.1 TEM images of (a) colloidal silica and (b) fumed silica nanoparticle aggregates. Zhang et al. (2012) .274 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)",
    "Ceria has been used as an abrasive for ILD and STI CMP because of its high SiO 2 removal rate (RR).  It can form strong Ce eOeSi bonding during SiO 2polishing, lead- ing to a high SiO 2RR ( Cook, 1990 ).  eCeeOH\u00feeSieO/C04eCeeOeSie\u00feOH/C0(11. 1) Ceria abrasives show higher surface quality and selectivity as well as higher RRs of SiO 2than silica abrasives.  Thus, as an abrasive for SiO 2CMP, silica is being replaced by ceria.  Figure 11. 2 shows TEM images of ceria synthesized through the solid-state and solution-grown method ( Seo et al. , 2014 ).  The solid-state method produces ceria abrasives with a controllable crystallite size depending on synthesis conditions ( Kim et al. , 2003 ).  However, it has not only large particle size and poor size distribution, but also an angulated shape ( Figure 11. 2(a) ).  Thus, mechanical milling and \ufb01ltration processes are essential to obtain the desired particle size and uniform size distribution(Kim et al. , 2006 ).  Compared with the solid-state method, the solution-grown method produces spherical ceria abrasives with the desired particle size and uniform size dis- tribution ( Figure 11. 2(b) ).",
    "These characteristics of the solution-grown ceria lead to low defects during CMP. studied the physicochemicalproperties of solution-grown ceria to develop defect-free CMP slurries. In Section 11.3.3 , we will discuss the physicochemical properties of solution-grown ceria in detail. As an abrasive for metal CMP, alumina has been used because of high polish rate selectivity between metal (W or Cu) and a barrier metal (Ti/TiN or Ta/TaN) ( Krishnan et al., 2009 ). Alumina abrasive can exist in various phases ( a,b,g,o rd) depending on the calcination temperature. However, it commonly generates many defects duringpolishing because of its hardness. There have been several studies to overcome theselimitations ( Lei and Zhang, 2007; Zhang and Lei, 2008 ). Lei and Zhang developed the alumina/silica core eshell abrasive for polishing hard disk substrates. Zhang and Lei reported alumina composite abrasive grafted with polymethacrylic acid for glass pol-ishing. These composite abrasives show improved surface planarization and fewerscratches than pure alumina abrasives because of the cushioning effect of their (a)(a)(a) (b)(b)(b) Figure 11.2 TEM images of (a) solid-state ceria and (b) solution-grown ceria.

    "structure.  For this reason, alumina abrasives have been used as the composite structure rather than in pure form.  11. 2. 2 Dispersants Dispersants are widely used to improve dispersion stability.  According to the DLVO(Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and Overbeek) theory, particles in aqueous media can be agglomerated when van der Waals attraction is greater than electrostatic repulsion (Verwey et al. , 1999; Derjaguin and Landau, 1941 ).  By adding suitable dispersants, steric hindrance and electrostatic stabilization between the abrasives are obtained,which prevent abrasives from agglomerating.  Generally, abrasive particles in slurry are known to undergo transitions from bridging agglomeration /stable/depletion \ufb02occulation with an increase in disper- sant concentration ( Kim et al. , 2012 ).  At a low concentration, dispersants are insuf \ufb01- cient for full coverage of the abrasive surface.  The free segments (loops and tails) of the adsorbed dispersant on the abrasive surface can attach to other abrasives, leading to bridging agglomeration.  When an adequate amount of dispersant is added, it fullycovers the abrasive surface, which can improve the dispersion stability through sterichindrance and electrostatic stabilization.",
    "Also, dispersants should have strong adsorp-tion energy with the abrasive surface.  in bridging \ufb02occulation ( Sigmund et al. , 2000 ).  At a high concentration of disper- sants, free dispersants (not adsorbed) can promote \ufb02occulation of the stable slurry through a depletion mechanism ( Asakura and Oosawa, 1954, 1958 ).  When two parti- cle surfaces approach each other at a distance less than the effective diameter of unab-sorbed dispersants, the dispersants are excluded from the interparticle gap, resulting inan osmotic pressure.  This osmotic pressure generates an attractive force between theabrasive particles, which promotes their \ufb02occulation.  Thus, it is important to add an adequate amount of dispersants for improved dispersion stability.  Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models can be used to describe the adsorption behavior of dispersants on an abrasive surface.  The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model assumes that the particle surface is homogeneously covered by the monolayer dispersant.  It is expressed as follows: C e=Qe\u00bcCe=Qm\u00fe1=\u00f0KLQm\u00de (11.",
    "2) where Qeis the adsorbed amount of dispersant per surface area of particle at equilib- rium (mg/m2),Ceis the concentration of dispersant in the bulk solution (mg/L), Qmis the maximum adsorbed amount of dispersant on particle surface (mg/m2), and KLis related to the af \ufb01nity of adsorption (L/mg). Freundlich adsorption isotherm model below is used in heterogeneous systems: Qe\u00bcKFC1=n e (11.3)276 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)",

The values of KFand 1/ nare determined from the intercept and slope of a linear plot of log Qeversus log Ce.  logQe\u00bclogKF\u00fe1=nlogCe (11. 4) A smaller value of 1/ nindicates a stronger bond between dispersant and particle surface.  To identify the adsorption behavior of dispersant, data are \ufb01tted with Lang- muir and Freundlich adsorption models, and the adsorption model with a higher cor-relation coef \ufb01cient values is chosen.  Figure 11. 3 shows the adsorption isotherm of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on a ceria surface.  The Langmuir adsorption model ( R 2\u00bc0. 99) is a much better \ufb01t than the Freundlich adsorption model ( R2\u00bc0. 87), which indicates that PAA covers the ceria surface homogeneously.  To disperse abrasive particles that are us ed for CMP application, several disper- sants have been investigated.  Surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have b een investigated for silica slurries (Bu and Moudgil, 2007; Basim et al. , 2003 ).",
    "Basim et al. l es l u r r y( Basim et al., 2003 ). However, it also prevents direct contact between silica abrasives and the oxide \ufb01lm, resulting in a decrease in the friction force during polishing ( Figure 11.4 ). Since the removal of material by silica abrasive is mechanically dominant, the decrease in t he friction force inevitably leads to a lower material RR (MRR). Various dispersants have been used to disperse ceria abrasive in aqueous media. PAA has been widely used to disperse ceria abrasive in CMP ( Sehgal et al., 2005; Langmuir model Freundlich modelQe (mg/m2) Ce (mg/L)0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Figure 11.3 Langmuir and Freundlich plot adsorption isotherm of PAA on ceria surface.Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 277",
    "Pettersson et al. , 2000 ).  PAA, an anionic surfactant, can adsorb on the highly posi- tively charged ceria surface by the attractive electrostatic force.  Carboxylic ( eCOOH) groups of PAA adsorbed on the ceria surface are deprotonated to negatively charged carboxylate ( eCOO/C0) groups above their p Kaof 4. 5, which improves the dispersion stability through an increase in repulsive force between abrasives.  The ceria abrasiveschemically remove the materials through interaction between active sites on surfaceand\ufb01lm whereas silica abrasives mechanically remove the material ( Wang et al. , 2007; Dandu et al. , 2011 ).  For this reason, a signi \ufb01cant decrease in MRR is not observed because of the PAA adsorbed on the abrasive surface.  Kim et al.  proposedthat the coadsorption of poly(methyl methacrylate) and hydrogen citrate on the ceria surface can increase the repulsive force between abrasives, which improves dispersion stability ( Kim et al. , 2010 ). Figure 11. 5 shows SiO 2MRR and within-wafer nonunifor- mity (WIWNU) during STI CMP.",
    "The results show that the improved dispersion sta-bility leads to an increase in SiO 2MRR and improved uniformity. \ufb01lm. There are several reports that show highly active Ce3\u00feon a ceria surface has in \ufb02u- ence on SiO 2MRR ( Dandu et al., 2010; Kelsall, 1998 ). Dandu et al. identi \ufb01ed through UV-visible spectroscopy that several additives (arginine, ornithine, and lysine) can interact with Ce3\u00feon the ceria surface ( Dandu et al., 2010, 2011 ). These additives can block the Ce3\u00feon the abrasive surface by forming Ce eOeSi bondings during SiO 2polishing, leading to a signi \ufb01cant decrease in MRR. Thus, dispersants should be chosen by considering their chemical interaction with abrasives.

    "11. 2. 3 Passivation agents for high selectivity Passivation agents are used for selective removal of a speci \ufb01c material among various materials during CMP.  In STI CMP, polishing is stopped on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm after the step height structure of SiO 2is planarized.  In the absence of passivation agents, erosion of Si 3N4\ufb01lm, which has a direct in \ufb02uence on device yield, can occur.  Generally, an anionic surfactant such as PAA has been widely used as a passivation agent for obtain-ing high polish rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4(Park et al. , 2003; Kim et al. , 2008 ).  PAA can preferentially absorb on the highly positively charged Si 3N4surface through the attractive electrostatic force ( Hackley, 1997 ).  This PAA adsorption layer prevents the abrasive from polishing the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, resulting in high polish rate selec- tivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4.  Kim et al.  controlled the conformation of adsorbed PAA on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm with the addition of KNO 3(Kim et al. , 2008 ).

    "It is attributed to the charge screening of PAA by potassium ions.  The densely adsorbed PAA layer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm, formed at high ionic strength, prevents the ceria abrasives from polishing the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, which decreases the RR of Si 3N4\ufb01lm from 72 to 61 \u00c5/min, resulting in increased polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4.  Penta et al.  investigated four anionic surfactants with different functional groups as passivation agents for high selectivity in STI CMP ( Penta et al. , 2013a ). Figure 11. 7 shows the RRs of SiO 2and Si 3N4in the presence of four different anionic surfactants.  All anionic surfactants can form the bilayer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm below the isoelectric point of Si3N4.  A monolayer is formed through electrostatic interaction between SiO 2and Si3N4, followed by a secondary layer through hydrophobic interaction between the surfactant tails.  These adsorption layers suppress the Si 3N4MRR during polishing, leading to high polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4.  Contrary to these surfactants, the ionic salt K 2SO4adsorbs only weakly on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, and cannot suppress the Si 3N4MRR.",

    "Recently, various amino acids also have been investigated as passivation agents in STI CMP ( Penta et al. , 2013b; Veera et al. , 2009 ).  Penta et al.  reported that amino acids, having both an amine group and a carboxyl group, can suppress the removalof Si 3N4through formation of a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group of the amino acid and the nitrogen atoms on the Si 3N4.  The adsorption of amino acids on the Si 3N4can prevent the hydrolysis of the Si 3N4.  The removal of Si 3N4is signif- icantly suppressed.  In contrast with the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, amino acids on the SiO 2\ufb01lm are weakly bound, and it can be easily removed by abrasives during polishing.  As a result,the high polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4is shown.  Since these amino acids are sensitive to a change of pH, they exhibit an \u201con/off \u201dbehavior on the Si 3N4 passivation as a function of pH.  These characteristics of amino acids can be applied to formulate CMP slurries for next-generation devices that include new materials andcomplex structures.",
    "In NAND \ufb02ash memory beyond 60 nm, the self-aligned poly-Si \ufb02oating gates are constructed without the deposition of Si 3N4.  selectivity between SiO 2and poly-Si plays a key role in STI CMP for NAND \ufb02ash.  Hydrophobic surfac- tants that can preferentially adsorb on poly-Si \ufb01lm have been investigated as passiv- ation agents for achieving high selectivity between SiO 2and poly-Si.  The selectivity can be controlled through their different surface energies.  Poly-Si \ufb01lm has a lower surface energy than an SiO 2\ufb01lm, and this difference enables preferential adsorption of passivation agents on poly-Si \ufb01lm.  This passivation layer prevents the abrasive from polishing poly-Si \ufb01lm, resulting in high polish rate selectivity.

In general, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) has been widely used as the oxidize r for commercial metal slurries because of its low cost and powerful oxid izing capability.  However, it can form a thick and porous oxide layer with poor surface quality caused by the dissolution and oxidation reactions of W ( Lim et al. , 2013 ).  Fe ions catalyze the decomposition of H 2O2into the hydroxyl radicals ( \u2219OH), powerful oxidants, through the Fenton reaction.

The polarization curve of W \ufb01lm in the absence of Fe(NO 3)3shows active corrosion behavior because the oxidation layer formed on W \ufb01lm is thin.  However, with the addition of Fe(NO 3)3, the polarization curves of W \ufb01lm show anodic oxidation behavior.  With an increase in Fe(NO 3)3concentrations, current density is shifted to a lower value.  It means that the dissolution of the W \ufb01lm is reduced as a result of the formation of a denser oxidation layer.  Various metal salts (Al, Ru, Ce, Co, Mn, Cu, and Cr), which have multiple redox states, also decompose H 2O2into$OH through a Fenton-like reaction ( Bokare and Choi, 2014 ).  However, Fe ions have generally been used as a catalyst to decompose H 2O2into$OH because of (1) high abundance, (2) an environmentally friendly nature, (3) low toxicity,(4) a highly reactive redox cycle between Fe 2\u00feand Fe3\u00fe, and (5) low cost.

In conclusion, choice of suitable oxidizers is very important toachieve the improved CMP performances such as high MRR, high selectivity, unifor- mity, and low defects.  11. 2. 5 Inhibitors In order to obtain the high MRR, several CMP processes may be performed under high dissolution rate of metal \ufb01lm.

Among various characteristics of the slurry, abrasive particle size has signi \ufb01cant in- \ufb02uence on MRR.  There are two models, contact area model and indentation volume model, to explain it.  At the small abrasive particle, the contact area model is dominant. As abrasive size increases, the indentation volume model becomes more appropriate (Basim et al. , 2000 ).  According to Cook \u2019s hypothesis, the active sites on the abrasive surface also play a key role in MRR.  These active sites are in \ufb02uenced by various phys- icochemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration. Rheological behavior of CMP slurries is also important because their mass transporton the pad can effect three-body (slurry epadewafer) interaction.  Hence, it is very important to understand the characteristics of slurry because they have signi \ufb01cant in- \ufb02uence on CMP performances.  11. 3. 1 Abrasive characteristics: size and concentration Abrasives in the size range 30 e300 nm (aggregated size) have been used for polishing.

As shown inFigure 11.10(a) , the W MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size ( Bielmann et al., 1999 ). MRR based on the contact area model is expressed as follows ( Basim et al., 2000 ): MRRf/C16 AfC1=3 0$F/C01=3/C17 (11.5)284 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)",

The indenta- tion volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer becomes larger because of an in-crease in abrasive size, which can increase the MRR.  These opposite conclusions are because slurry formulation and material removal mechanisms are different depending on the types of materials to be polished.  In any case, the large abrasive sizes can produce the scratch defects on \ufb01lms during CMP (Remsen et al. , 2005, 2006 ).  Since the number of maximum permissible defects is continually lowered with decreasing device dimensions, CMP slurries containingsmaller abrasive sizes have been investigated.  The concentrations as well as the size of the abrasives have an effect on MRR.  There are three distinct regions of MRR dependence on abrasive concentration ( Lee et al. , 2009; Luo and Dornfeld, 2003 )(Figure 11. 11 ).  First, MRR rapidly increases with an increase in abrasive concentration, which indicates that chemical removal of material is dominant at low concentrations.",

    "rings caused by high-temperature synthesis ( >1300/C14C) and rapid thermal quenching.  In contrast, colloidal silica structures involved principally unstrained four-membered and larger rings formed by continued condensation reactions.  Figure 11. 19(b) shows FTIR analysis of silanol concentration in fumed and colloidal silica.  Broad peaks at4500 cm e1are related to the total (hydrogen-bonded and isolated) hydroxyl concentra- tion, and peaks at 3460 cme1and 3750 cme1are related to hydrogen-bonded vicinal and isolated silanols, respectively.  Fumed silica has a lower total hydroxyl content(2. 8 OH/nm 2) and a higher portion of isolated silanol than colloidal silica (4. 5 OH/ nm2).  These reactive sites on the surface produce $OH with H 2O2or water according to a Fenton-like reaction ( Fubini and Hubbard, 2003 ).  The reactivity between silica and H 2O2is very important because H 2O2has been widely used as oxidants for metal slurries.  Silica abrasives show different surface chemistry as the abrasive size decreases.  Kamiya et al.  studied the effect of silica size on surface silanol structure throughFTIR ( Kamiya et al. , 2000 ).",
    "For relatively small particles ( <10 nm in diameter), the isolated silanol is observed.  hydrogen-bonded silanol groups are Increased due to the strong hydration force between the silanols.  These size-dependent differences of surface chemistry of silica can lead to a variation of sur-face charge on silica ( Puddu and Perry, 2014 )(Figure 11. 20 ).  With an increase in the particle size, an increase in surface charge is observed.  Although there is no report thatthe effect of surface chemistry varied with particle size on CMP performance, under-standing the surface chemistry of abrasive particles is very important because it has asigni\ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performance.

    "11.3.4 Rheological behavior During polishing, CMP slurries are transported into the pores of the polishing pad by high speed rotation. These slurries form a liquid \ufb01lm between the polishing pad and the wafer, which determines the contact regime between them. Figure 11.21 is the coef \ufb01- cient of friction (COF) as a function of a lubrication parameter ( hV/P), which is known as the Stribeck curve; it shows three distinct regions: boundary lubrication, mixedlubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication ( Philipossian and Olsen, 2003 ). Boundary lubrication is dominated by solid esolid contact. In this regime, the COF shows a high value because of direct contact between the solid surfaces. However, the COF is not Figure 11.20 Zeta potential of silica nanoparticles as a function of pH. Puddu and Perry (2014) .

    "signi\ufb01cantly changed despite an increase in the lubrication parameter.  The second re- gion is known as partial lubrication, where the liquid \ufb01lm formed between the pad and wafer is more important and the COF decreases with an increase in the lubricationparameter.  The third region is hydrodynamic lubrication, which shows the low COFvalue.  The pad and wafer are fully separated because of the formation of thick liquid\ufb01lm.  The COF increases slightly with an increase in the lubrication parameter.  Mul- lany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically investigated the effect of slurry vis-cosity on MRR ( Mullany and Byrne, 2003 ).  As viscosity is increased while other variables such as velocity and pressure were kept constant, the thickness of liquid \ufb01lm is greater ( Figure 11. 22(a) ).  This thick liquid \ufb01lm decreases the COF value, result- ing in a decrease in MRR ( Figure 11. 22(b) ).  The COF against the lubrication param- eter shows a downward slope.  Thus, they suggested that the experiment was processedin the partial lubrication region.  11.",
    "4 Conclusion In this chapter, we described the role of each component in CMP slurry, and discussed the characterization of slurries for CMP. CMP slurries in a variety of ways. However, thereis still a need to understand more profoundly how the slurry characteristics affect CMPperformance. These issues can be solved through a fundamental study of powder tech-nology, surface chemistry, and colloidal chemistry. References Asakura, S., Oosawa, F., 1954.
