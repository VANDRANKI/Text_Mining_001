The relationship between the grain size, the morphology of the CeO2 crystallites, and the reaction conditions such as temperature, time, and acidity of the medium was studied. The experiments showed that with increasing reaction temperature and time, the CeO2 crystallites grew larger. The crystallites synthesized in an acidic hydrothermal medium were larger and had a more regular morphology than the ones synthesized in a neutral or alkaline medium when the reaction temperature and time were fixed. The CeO2 crystallites synthesized in an acidic medium were monodispersed; however, there was vigorous agglomeration among the grains synthesized in a neutral or alkaline medium. It was demonstrated that the hydrothermal treatment was an Ostwald ripening process and the acidity (pH) of the used hydrothermal medium played a key role in the dissolution of smaller grains. It is proposed that the dissolution process can control the kinetics of the growth of larger grains.","2002","2023-03-15 00:49:41","2024-07-01 23:10:52","2023-03-15 00:49:41","2462-2468","","10","85","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00481.x","","/Users/school/Zotero/storage/D8KC9QTQ/Wu et al. - 2002 - Effect of pH of Medium on Hydrothermal Synthesis o.pdf; /Users/school/Zotero/storage/YNJ4GAHR/Wu et al. - 2002 - Effect of pH of Medium on Hydrothermal Synthesis o.pdf; /Users/school/Zotero/storage/FC6WQB9S/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00481.html; /Users/school/Zotero/storage/9ZIK82A4/Wu et al_2002_Effect of pH of Medium on Hydrothermal Synthesis of Nanocrystalline Cerium(IV).pdf","","synthesis; Exported; Highlighted_box","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only the cerium oxides prepared at temperatures above 700°C exhibited good glass polishing capabilities in terms of both the material removal rate and the quality of the polished surface; the maximum polishing efficiency was produced by the samples annealed at 1050°C.

Structural characterization revealed that with the calcination temperature increasing from 500 to 700 °C, the products maintained a hierarchical structure and primary nanocrystals changed from spherical to octahedral particles. Significant fusion occurred between the primary nanocrystals and the surface of the octahedrons became smooth at the calcination temperature of 800 °C. Single crystal CeO2 octahedrons were formed when the calcination temperature reached 900 °C. The change in microstructure induced by elevated calcination temperature led to increased mechanical hardness and decreased surface chemical activity (specific surface area and surface Ce3+ concentration) of the octahedrons, which had an impact on their polishing performance. The polishing experiments on K9 glass showed that the polishing rate first increased and then decreased with the increment of calcination temperature, indicating that in addition to the mechanical hardness, the surface chemical activity of the octahedrons is also important for material removal. Owing to the best matching of chemical activity and mechanical hardness, CeO2 octahedrons calcinated at 700 °C exhibited the highest polishing rate and the best surface quality for K9 glass.","2022-06-01","2024-03-12 02:34:51","2024-07-01 23:09:39","","16554-16560","","26","12","","RSC Adv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35754902 PMCID: PMC9168675","","/Users/school/Zotero/storage/IY8F9YL5/Li et al_2022_Changing the calcination temperature to tune the microstructure and polishing.pdf","","synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cerium dioxide powder was produced from a mixture of rare earth carbonates by conversion to oxides, reacting with acid to separate a sediment of CeO(OH)2 from solution containing the trivalent rare earth ions, washing the sediment, and drying and annealing it to produce finely divided CeO2. Physical and chemical investigations of each stage of the processing were performed. A relation was established between the properties of CeO(OH)2 (such as degree of fineness and crystal structure) and the properties of the REE oxides that were used. It was shown that very fine REE oxides generate fine CeO(OH)2. It was also shown that to obtain CeO2 powder with high specific surface area and perfect crystal structure, the CeO(OH)2 must be annealed in two steps: (1) dehydration of intermediate CeO1.5(OH) to produce very fine powder, and (2) dehydration at 800–1050°C.","2000-05-24","2024-03-12 02:46:58","2024-07-01 23:10:52","","421-425","","","303","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/s0925-8388(00)00651-4 MAG ID: 2049245966","","/Users/school/Zotero/storage/A3PU9LW9/V.

Rare earth carbonates, as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, directly affect the morphology of ceria-based abrasives, which, in turn, affects the material removal rate (MRR) and the surface roughness (Ra) after polishing. Herein, rare earth carbonates with different morphologies were obtained by adjusting reaction parameters during precipitation, including flake, spindle, and spheroid. Moreover, the phase of precursors was analyzed, and the evolution process of morphology from precursors to ceria-based abrasives was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was explored. The results show that the primary particles of ceria-based abrasives are near-spherical, but the morphology and dispersion of the secondary particles are obviously inherited from precursors. Among them, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives prepared by nearly monodisperse near-spherical precursors show better uniformity and higher dispersion, and they not only achieve the lowest Ra but also obtain a higher MRR of 555 nm/min (9 wt.%) for polishing TFT-LCD glass substrates. The result is significant for the further optimization and application of high-performance ceria-based abrasives.","2022-10-27","2024-03-12 02:51:13","2024-07-01 23:10:17","","7525-7525","","21","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.3390/ma15217525 MAG ID: 4307634458 PMID: 36363118","","/Users/school/Zotero/storage/UV9D6DIF/Yuanyuan Zheng et al_2022_The Effects of Precursors on the Morphology and Chemical Mechanical Polishing.pdf","","synthesis; Exported; Highlighted_box","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CeO2 abrasives with high chemical activity were prepared by the molten salt method under a reducing atmosphere. The crystal structure and morphology of CeO2 abrasives were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultravioletevisible diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (UVeVis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The CeO2 abrasives were obtained under different atmospheres (Air, Ar, and Ar/H2). With the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, the morphology of the abrasives transforms from spherical to octahedral, while more oxygen vacancies and Ce3þ are generated on the surface of CeO2 abrasives. The CMP experiments show that the MRRs of the CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives on SiO2 substrates are 337.60, 578.74, and 691.28 nm/min, respectively. Moreover, as conﬁrmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the substrate surfaces exhibit low roughness (~0.5 nm) after being polished using all of the prepared samples. Especially, the MRR of CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives is increased by 104.76% compared with CeO2-air abrasives. The improved CMP performance is attributed to the increased Ce3þ concentration and the octahedral morphology of the abrasives enhancing the chemical reaction and mechanical removal at the abrasiveesubstrate interface.","2023-10","2024-03-12 03:29:55","2024-07-28 23:08:10","2024-03-12 03:29:55","1627-1635","","10","41","","Journal of Rare Earths","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/school/Zotero/storage/PRWQALZD/Xu et al. - 2023 - Preparation of CeO2 abrasives by reducing atmosphe.pdf","","synthesis; Exported; Highlighted_box","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Core silica nanoparticles were initially synthesized using micro-emulsion method. Ceria coating on these ultrafine and spherical silica nanoparticles was achieved using controlled chemical precipitation method. Study of various parameters influencing the formation of ceria coated silica nanoparticles of size less than 100nm has been undertaken and reported. Ceria coating over silica nanoparticles was varied by controlling the reaction temperature, pH and precursor concentrations.

The polish rate of the latter was significantly higher than that of pure ceria. The experiments were carried out using different concentrations of the abrasives at pH 4 and 10.

Three slurry samples were prepared based on a 1.0 wt.% abrasive concentration with different sizes of ceria particles. The step height and dishing reduction were investigated as a function of the polishing time with pattern wafers in prepared slurries. The reduction in thickness as a function of the polishing time varied between the different slurries. The dependence of the step height reduction of the patterned wafer on the polishing time showed non-linear behavior in all of the tested slurries. The amount of dishing also varied with the type of slurry. The changes in the cross-sectional profiles of the oxide as a function of the polishing time were analyzed, in order to establish a dishing and step height reduction model depending on the abrasive size. The step height variation and dishing were varied with the size of the abrasive. The observed results were explained by the contribution of inactive particles, which depended on relative size of the abrasives and the height of the remaining oxide layer.","2005-11-21","2024-03-25 19:49:45","2024-03-25 19:53:19","2024-03-25 19:49:45","1751-1754","","5","200","","Surface and Coatings Technology","","ICMCTF 2005","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/school/Zotero/storage/4EX7PKWI/Lim et al_2005_The effect of CeO2 abrasive size on dishing and step height reduction of.pdf; /Users/school/Zotero/storage/RLXM3WCX/S0257897205008649.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
