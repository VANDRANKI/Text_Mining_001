Several colloidal slurries with various additives can yield the desired high rate selectivity between\nthe oxide and nitride \ufb01lms during CMP while maintaining an acceptably low nitride rate. Here, many of such high selectivity STICMP slurries described in the literature are reviewed along with the characteristics of the colloidal dispersions like the abrasives,\nadditives, the interactions between them and with the \ufb01lms being planarized and the associated pH range in which the high selectivity\nis observed. The mechanisms proposed to explain the high reactivity of ceria with oxide, the role of additives in suppressing thenitride removal rate and resulting high selectivity are discussed.

This paper is part of the JSS\nFocus Issue on Chemical Mechanical Planarization: Advanced Material and Consumable Challenges.\nChemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is one of the important\nenabling processes in facilitating multilevel metallization (in some\ncases reaching up to 14 levels) and incorporation of novel gate andchannel materials at the component level in modern semiconduc-tor device manufacturing where its use has become widespread andubiquitous.\n1\u20136Here, we review recent advances and remaining chal-\nlenges in one speci\ufb01c application of CMP, the shallow trench isolation(STI) process. STI is a method of electrically isolating active areasusing trenches created in the Si substrate around the active elementsand \ufb01lling it with an insulating dielectric, such as silicon dioxide or sil-icon oxy-nitride or silicon carbonitride.\n7\u201311Process details of the STI\nstructures are available in numerous publications. There are a mul-titude of techniques available for oxide deposition and even thoughthe resulting oxides have very different properties, for simplicity we\ndo not distinguish between them in this review. For completeness and\nease of reference, a schematic representation of the STI process isgiven in Figure 1. While the trenches are being \ufb01lled, silicon dioxide\nalso deposits over unwanted areas on the entire wafer (since selective\ndeposition in trenches only is not possible) creating an uneven topog-raphy. The excess and unwanted oxide has to be completely removedand CMP has proven to be the only viable and robust global and localplanarization capable process technology.\nHere, as shown in Figure 1, presence of a very thin silicon nitride\nstop layer (deposited on another thin pad oxide layer to control \ufb01lm\nstress) is an essential and integral part of the process. This nitride stoplayer prevents any damage during planarization to the all-importantepitaxially grown surface underneath and is itself removed by a wetetch process subsequent to the overburden oxide removal. Since theintegrity of the nitride layer is crucial, thinning of the nitride shouldbe minimized at all costs, implying that the oxide to nitride removalrate (RR) ratio, or selectivity, must be high. At the same time, a veryhigh oxide \ufb01lm RR can lead to undesirable thinning of the \ufb01eld oxidein the trenches, making accurate end point control critical. Finally,if any of the oxide over the nitride is not removed, it interferes withthe subsequent removal of the nitride itself. Indeed, while planarizingpatterned STI features, metrics like the extent of nitride and \ufb01eld oxide\n\u2217Electrochemical Society Active Member.\ncPresent address: Intel Corp., Hillsboro, Oregon 97124, USA.\nzE-mail: babu@clarkson.eduloss across widely varying patterns, dishing, sensitivity to overpolish,\ndefects, and within wafer (WIW) and die (WID) uniformity - and notjust selectivity \u2013 become overarching for evaluating the performanceof a slurry and we discuss them here only in a cursory manner and focusmostly on polish rates and the underlying mechanisms. As devicedimensions continue to shrink, meeting these combined challengeshas become even more dif\ufb01cult.\nIt is known that the rate selectivity can be altered by carefully\nchoosing the components, viz. abrasives and additives, of the colloidal\nslurry used to achieve the planarization with more emphasis beingplaced now on their role on defects in the post-polished surfaces.\n12\nA low oxide polish rate even with complete suppression of nitrideremoval is not desirable, since the excess oxide has to be removedrapidly to ensure adequate throughput. As such, the STI planariza-\ntion can sometimes be implemented in two steps, \ufb01rst with a high\nselectivity and high oxide polish rate slurry to remove most of theoverburden oxide followed by a second step in which a low or 1:1selectivity slurry is use. Normally, ceria or silica based slurries areemployed in STI CMP, with a more recent emergence of core/shelltype abrasives, again with the expectation of mitigating defects. In theabsence of any additives, both the silica or ceria slurries tend to polishnot only the oxide but also the nitride surface at rates that are notlow enough. Compared to silica abrasives, ceria particles yield higherremoval rates of both oxide and nitride surfaces.\n13,14Certain chemi-\ncals, when added to the slurry, suppress the nitride removal without\nadversely affecting the oxide removal, thus enhancing the selectivity.In some applications such as damascene gate process, the nitride RRmust be higher than oxide RR, i.e. reverse of the usual selectivity ofthe STI process.\n15\nSince CMP uses abrasives, scratches can form on the surface\nand lead to yield loss. Other defects, such as residual particles,\nneed to be removed in post-CMP cleaning step. The defect leveland type of defects formed depend, as in any CMP process, on theslurry formulation as well as other parameters such as the shape andsize of abrasives, type of pad used, conditioning, operating pres-sure etc. In this review, we focus our attention on high selectiv-ity STI CMP slurries with very low nitride polish rates and slur-ries with reverse selectivity as well as the underlying mechanisms.The status of experimental results and analysis are compiled and\nthe models proposed to explain them are summarized. The gaps\nin the literature are identi\ufb01ed and directions for future work areoutlined.\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract).\u00a0 ecsdl.org/site/terms_use  address.

This model was initially usedon metals\n16and later extended to the polishing of glass surfaces.17\nBased on the polishing rates of glass in ethylene glycol and watermixture, Silvernail and Goetzinger\n18identi\ufb01ed the necessity for the\npresence of water for glass polishing. Later, Iler19proposed that the\nSi-O-Si bonds present on the surface of silica react with water, given\nby a reversible polymerization and depolymerization reaction, shownbelow.\n(SiO\n2)x+2H 2O\u2194(SiO 2)x\u22121+Si(OH)4\nSilicon dioxide surface can be polished by different metal oxide abra-\nsives such as those of cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxideand thorium oxide besides silicon dioxide itself. Due to its amphotericnature, ceria was considered an excellent polishing agent comparedto other metal oxides. Cook\n13proposed that polishing particles such\nas ceria or zirconia possess a great af\ufb01nity toward the oxide, which\nhe called as \u201cchemical-tooth\u201d, which helps in breaking the bonds onthe silica surface. The surface of silicon dioxide, in water, is expectedto be terminated with -Si-OH. At some of these sites, an OH\n\u2212ion\nin water can remove H+, resulting in -Si-O\u2212termination. According\nto the mechanism proposed by Cook13cerium oxide, when dispersed\nin water, contains Ce-OH groups, which react with the surface sites\nSi-O\u2212forming Ce-O-Si and subsequently release Si(OH) 4into theCe4+\nO-\nSi4+Si4+Adapted from Cook 13\nO-(a)\nCeria\nLump of SiO2SiO2lump \ninto the dispersionAdapted from Ref. \nHoshino et al. 22(b)\nCe3+ \nO- O-\nSi4+ Proposed Model \nOxygen Vacancy(c) \nFigure 2.

The proposed reaction is written as\n-Ce-OH +-Si-O\u2212\u2194-Si-O-Ce- +OH\u2212\nSince the Ce-O-Si bonds are stronger than Si-O-Si bonds, this results\nin the polishing of the silicon dioxide surface by both chemical andmechanical actions (Figure 2a).\n13Thus, SiO 2is removed one molecule\nat a time, as Si(OH) 4.\nA similar mechanism was proposed by Kelsall,20but he suggested\nthat it is the Ce3+species that are present on the surface of ceria abra-\nsives that react with the hydrated silicon dioxide surface. Later, Sabiaand Stevens\n21proposed that the polishing between the ceria abrasives\nand silicon dioxide is due to the reaction between the particles and\nthe work surface, promoted by the presence of Ce3+on the abrasive\nsurface. Later, Hoshino et al.,22proposed a different model in which\nthe Si-O-Si bonds react with hydroxylated ceria in water, formingCe-O-Si bonds, and removing SiO\n2in the form of lumps (Figure 2b)\nrather than in the form of single molecules of Si(OH) 4as proposed\nby Cook.13They supported this hypothesis using Fourier transform\ninfra-red spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emis-sion spectroscopy analysis of the post polish slurry containing thematerial removed. Wang et al.\n23reported that the material RR in-\ncreased from 250 nm/min to 675 nm/min when the concentration ofceria abrasives in the slurry was lowered from 1 wt% to 0.25 wt% atpH 4, which is counter intuitive since an increase in abrasive concen-tration may be expected to lead to an increase in RR in the initial stagesand saturation at some higher abrasive concentrations. Based on theUV-VIS absorption spectra of solutions containing various quantitiesof ceria abrasives, they claimed that a decrease in the concentrationof ceria in the slurry resulted in the conversion of Ce\n4+to Ce3+,a g a i n\nsuggesting an important role for Ce3+. However, there are no con\ufb01r-\nmatory reports in literature on the decrease in silicon dioxide RR withan increase in ceria concentration.\nUsing their own data and the results of Kelsall\n21and Wang et al.,23\nVeera Dandu et al.24proposed speci\ufb01cally that Ce3+(and not Ce4+)\npresent on the ceria abrasives enhance the oxide RR (Figure 2c). This\nhypothesis was supported by UV-visible spectroscopy data where thespectral peak height associated with the Ce\n3+was monitored as well\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract).\u00a0 ecsdl.org/site/terms_use  address.

They also showed that whenthe concentrations of the additives (used to suppress nitride but notoxide removal) were high enough, the oxide removal rates were alsoreduced, likely due to the blocking of the active Ce\n3+surface sites by\nthe additives. More recently, Seo et al.25proposed that the reactivity\nof ceria particles depends on the physicochemical conditions duringtheir synthesis. Based on adsorption isotherms and theoretical analy-ses using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they predictedthat nitrate ions (source of nitrate is either the precursor or the pH ad-justing agent or both) show a higher af\ufb01nity than hydroxyl ions towardsilicate groups. CMP results showed that the ceria functionalized withnitrate groups exhibit higher removal rates when compared to ceriafunctionalized with hydroxyl groups. We discuss the role of the Ce\n3+\nsurface species at some length later in the section on the reactivity ofceria abrasives.\nSilicon nitride removal mechanism.\u2014 Suppression of the nitride\n\ufb01lm RR is essential to an acceptable STI process. An understandingof the nitride polishing mechanism will give an insight in choosingan additive which can enhance the selectivity. Silicon nitride is harderthan silicon dioxide or ceria. When exposed to water or air, the nitridesurface gets easily oxidized to silicon dioxide.\n26The overall oxidation\nreactions are given below.\nSi3N4+3O 2\u21923S i O 2+2N 2\nSi3N4+6H 2O\u21923S i O 2+4N H 3\nDuring the CMP of silicon nitride, it is believed that the nitride layeris not removed directly, but only the top layer consisting of silicondioxide is removed. Hu et al.\n27proposed a sequence of hydrolysis\nreactions that convert the Si 3N on the nitride surface to \u2013Si-O-Si-\nstructures and NH 3.\nDuring CMP, the chemically modi\ufb01ed nitride surface layer may be\nfurther hydrated in the presence of water,\n\u2261Si-O-Si \u2261+ H2O\u2192Si(OH)4\nwith the hydrolyzed silica being removed by mechanical wear.27Note\nthat this equation is not balanced. This suggests that if the conversion\nof silicon nitride to oxide is inhibited, then the nitride removal maybe suppressed since the ceria particles are softer than the nitride \ufb01lm.Indeed, proline and other amino acids, when added to a ceria slurry,can preferentially adsorb on the surface of silicon nitride preventingits oxidation to silicon dioxide and suppress nitride removal.\n28\nNitride rate suppression mechanism.\u2014 It is important to reiterate\nthat in STI CMP, a low nitride RR ( <1 nm/min) is a key require-\nment. Even a moderate nitride RR (e.g. \u223cfew nm/min) will cause\nunacceptable thinning of the nitride stop layer. In order to understand\nhow various additives suppress the nitride or, in some cases, oxideremoval, various studies have been performed and the reports aresummarized below. America and Babu\n28proposed that the nitride RR\ncan be reduced to low values by adding a suitable chemical, an aminoacid, which adsorbs on the nitride and inhibits its hydrolysis to silicondioxide. The oxygen atoms present on the carboxylic group of theadditives form a bidentate structure with the silanol groups presenton the surface of silicon nitride along with simultaneous hydrogenbonding between the amino H and surface N atom (Figure 3). These\nbonds are strong enough to prevent exposure of the underlying nitride\ufb01lm to the abrasives. They also suggested that, for the additive to beeffective, the hydrogen bonding group of the additive be in the alphaposition relative to the acid group.\nCarter and Johns\n29proposed that the nitride removal rates in high\nselective slurries are suppressed by a site blocking mechanism inwhich the additives block the active sites on silicon nitride, preventingthem from forming SiO\n\u2212and inhibiting further polishing. They also\nsuggested that, when a suf\ufb01ciently high concentration of the additives\nis used in the slurry, the additives are likely to suppress silicon dioxideRR also. In another study with three different additives - pyridine\nBidentate \nBonding\nHydrogen \nBondingNitrogen\nCarbon\nSilicon\nOxygen\nHydrogen\nFigure 3. Cartoon showing the bond formation between proline and silicon\nnitride surface. Adapted from America and Babu.28\nHCl, imidazole and piperazine -with ceria slurries, it was reported the\nnitride RR was suppressed at pH 4 and 5 while the oxide removal ratesremained high.\n30These authors reported that the additives cover the\nsurface of silicon nitride more or less completely, but there is only a\npartial coverage on the surface of silicon dioxide with relatively weakcoupling, which results in continued polishing of silicon dioxide.\nPenta et al.\n31investigated silicon dioxide and silicon nitride re-\nmoval in ceria based slurries, in the presence of picolinic acid, nico-\ntinic acid, proline and \u03b3-amino butyric acid as a function of pH and\nadditive concentration. These amino acids, based on pKa values, can\nexist in different forms in different pH ranges. The results were ana-lyzed by comparing the polishing behavior with the additive speciespresent at the respective slurry pH. The adsorption of amino acidonto the silicon dioxide and silicon nitride surfaces at various pH wasevaulated by derivative thermograms. The results showed that the pro-tonated amino group, present only in a speci\ufb01c pH range, can forma strong hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of the silicon nitridesurface and the strength of this bond hinders nitride hydrolysis as wellas subsequent polishing. This result was recently extended to other\nclasses of additives, namley alcohols and carboxylic acids, see Penta\net al in this focus issue.\nHowever, for effective suppression of nitride removal, the amino\nacid must be available in suf\ufb01cient quantity, which may not be the case\nif it is also strongly adsorbed on the high surface area abrasive parti-cles. This can explain the results of Manivannan and Ramanathan,\n32\nwho found that in ceria based slurries, at pH 4, addition of glutamicacid lowered the oxide RR from \u223c40 nm/min to <1 nm/min, and\nthe nitride RR from \u223c8 nm/min to <1 nm/min while at pH 5, 6\nand 7, the oxide RR was \u223c60 nm/min while the nitride RR was\n<1 nm/min.However, glutamic acid did not lower the oxide and ni-tride rates in silica slurries. In this case, since the surface area of theparticles in the 5 wt% silica dispersion is much larger than the surfacearea of the particles in the ceria based slurries (0.25 wt%) and theamino acids tend to adsorb well on the silica surface,\n30,33it is likely\nthat the amino acid remaining in the solution in the silica slurry is not\nsuf\ufb01cient to prevent nitride removal.31\nAlso, in some cases, the additive can adsorb on both oxide and\nnitride surfaces, but still lower only the nitride rate and not the oxiderate.\n30,33In such cases, the strength of the coupling between the addi-\ntive and the \ufb01lm being polished is important as was shown by Veera\nDandu et al.30In this case, even though pyridine HCl adsorbed on\nboth oxide and nitride surfaces, it lowered only the nitride rate. Basedon contact angle and polishing rate data, they concluded that the ad-ditive was easily removed by the polishing process from the oxide\nbut not from the nitride, presumably due to stronger coupling. Sim-\nilar argument can be used to explain the results of Nagendra Prasadand Ramanathan\n33who found that, even though both L-proline and\nL-arginine adsorb to a similar extent on the surface of silicon dioxideat pH 9, 10 and 11 and to a smaller but again similar extent on siliconnitride, proline suppressed only nitride RR while arginine suppressedboth oxide and nitride removal rates.\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract).\u00a0 ecsdl.org/site/terms_use  address.

This list is incomplete and the patents cata-\nlogue many more additives as selectivity enhancement agents. Theselectivity values should not be considered precise since they canvary signi\ufb01cantly even with only small changes, even if caused byexperimental error, in the nitride polish rates.\nThe actual selectivity depends on the abrasive and additive con-\ncentrations and the pH of the slurry as well as the characteristics ofthe ceria used. Some slurries exhibit high selectivity only in a nar-r o wp Hr a n g e\n34\u201337while others exhibit high selectivity in a wider pH\nrange.42\u201346While some of the patents mention the particle size and the\nmethod of synthesis of the ceria abrasive (colloidal, solid state dis-\nplacement, etc.), such information was not provided in most cases. In\na few patents, the possible mechanism of high selectivity was hintedat,\n29,42\u201346,49for example, the adsorption of the additive on the nitride\nsurface, but in most there was no explanation. In some cases, appar-ently contradictory results were observed. For example, Srinivasanet al.\n42\u201346reported that slurries with L-proline yielded high selectivity\nwhile Carter and John29reported that a similar slurry yielded low se-lectivity. This is likely due to differences in the method of synthesis,purity level and size of the ceria abrasives used, as discussed later inthe section on the reactivity of ceria.\nSlurries based on other abrasives.\u2014 Most of the reported studies\non STI CMP dispersions used ceria or silica abrasives. Even thoughceria particles are known to be prone to cause more defects, silicaslurries are not the preferred choice in many cases due to high solidsrequirement ( >10 wt%) to obtain reasonable oxide RRs and associated\ndefects and post-CMP cleaning challenges. In contrast, ceria can yield\nhigh RRs with even \u223c0.25 wt% of particle loading which can result in\nsigni\ufb01cant cost savings for both high volume manufacturing and waste\ntreatment. Also, it remains a challenge to enhance rate selectivity withsilica slurries. Some of the additives reported to yield high selectiv-ity, relatively speaking, in silica based slurries are: cerium nitrateand acetic acid,\n56triethanol amine,57surfactants such as ammonium\nlauryl sulfate, ammonium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and dodecylben-zenesulfonic acid or triethanolamine dodecylbenzenesulfonate.\n58\nPenta et al.,59investigated the removal of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms in\nslurries with 10 wt% silica in the pH range of 2 to10 containing anionicsurfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), dodecyl phosphate (DDP) and sodium laurylsarcosine (SLS). When the pH was between 2 to 4, the nitride pol-ishing rate was suppressed to <1 nm/min without affecting oxide\nremoval rates. Beyond pH 4, silicon nitride removal was not sup-\npressed. The authors proposed that when the slurry pH <IEP of the\nnitride surface, nitride rate suppression is caused by the adsorption of\nthe anionic surfactants, validated by TGA results and zeta potentialmeasurements.\nReverse Selectivity\nDuring the fabrication sequence of metal gates, slurries with\nhigh nitride RR and low oxide RR are required.\n15,60,61It is also\npossible to use such slurries to remove the nitride layer remaining\nTable I.

The combination of abrasivesand additives employed, the pH range in which reverse selectivity wasreported and the reverse selectivity values are summarized in Table II\nfor reference.\nVeera Dandu et al.\n64proposed that the negatively charged car-\nboxylic groups of the PAD polymer strongly bind to the positivelycharged ceria surface, possibly by bi-dentate structure, while thecationic amine groups are on the unadsorbed side away from theceria surface. These amine groups can bind to the negatively chargedsub-oxide on the nitride surface and, hence, the oxide layer can bepulled away from the nitride surface by the relative motion of the waferacross the pad, presumably due to the weak nature of Si-Si presentat the interface between sub-oxide and silicon nitride. Furthermore,it is very likely that the cationic amine groups of the polymer bind\nstrongly to the negatively charged silicon dioxide surface while the\nanionic carboxylic acids are on the unadsorbed side. Similarly, Kimet al.\n61showed that the adsorption of the cationic polymer, PEI on the\nsurface of silicon dioxide is the key factor in the suppression of oxideRR. The adsorbed PEI presumably prevents the dissolution of silicondioxide into the solution.\nCeria abrasive surfaces contains Ce\n3+which is believed to be\nchemically active, as described later in the section on reactivity of\nceria. It seems that the Ce3+on the surface of ceria abrasivea inter-\nacts with the suboxide formed on the silicon nitride \ufb01lms forming a\ncomplex, which consists of Ce-O-Si structures, and pulls the subox-ide during polishing, presumably since Ce-O-Si structures are muchstronger that Si-O-Si structures (Fig. 2c). The suboxide is regenerated\nby hydrolysis and this removal process continues. The silicon nitride\nRR is suppressed when the reactivity of Ce\n3+on the ceria abrasive\nsurface is blocked and/or the hydrolysis reaction of the nitride conver-\nsion to silicon dioxide is hindered due to the adsorption of differentadditives.\n65\nUsing zirconia- and silica-based dispersions, high silicon nitride\nand low silicon dioxide removal rates were reported by Natarajan\net al.66Without any additives, zirconia gave a reverse selectivity of\n78 at pH 4, while 2 wt% arginine in a 10 wt% silica slurry at pH\n8 gave a reverse selectivity of 7.66The exact mechanism of silicon\nnitride polishing with these slurries was not explained. Veera Danduet al.\n67showed that dispersions of silica particles functionalized with\nphosphate groups give higher nitride RR and low oxide RR, as may beexpected from the use of hot phosphoric acid to etch nitride selectivelyover oxide. Using diethylphosphato-ethyltriethoxysilane (DPTS) asthe precursor, the functionalized silica particles were synthesized inalcohol media to prevent hydrolysis and condensation of DPTS. Theunreacted DPTS was removed from the dispersion by dialysis andthen diluted with deionized water, while the isopropyl alcohol andethanol formed during this process were removed using a rotovap.DPTS molecules have an ethanol group on one end and a phosphategroup on the other end. During polishing, the phosphate end group ofthe DPTS molecule tethered to a silica abrasive reacts with the siliconnitride surface resulting in high RRs of silicon nitride \ufb01lm (Figure 4).\nCharacteristics of Ceria Abrasives\nNature and type of ceria abrasives.\u2014 As was mentioned earlier,\nthe type of ceria abrasives used in formulating a slurry can have aprofound effect on both rate selectivity and defectivity, as well as itcolloidal properties.\n12For example, Kim et al.68prepared ceria abra-\nsives by calcining cerium carbonate at 650\u25e6C for 4 h (sample A) and\n6h (sample B), milled the particles and evaluated their performance.\nSlurry A yielded lower oxide RR, more number of scratches and apoorer within wafer non-uniformity. The XRD based grain size ofparticles A was smaller than that of B, but the agglomerate size of Ain slurry was larger than that of B. They suggested that at the shorterduration (4 h), the conversion was incomplete and resulted in lowercrystallinity which led to easy breakdown of the particles. The smallerparticles agglomerated causing lower oxide RR and worse defectivity.In another report, Kim et al.\n69calcined cerium carbonate at 650\u25e6C\nfor 4 h under controlled air \ufb02ow conditions. The air \ufb02ow conditions\nduring synthesis were 35, 5 and 0 m3/h for samples A, B and C respec-\ntively. The particles were subsequently wet milled and dispersed in\nslurry at pH 8, with poly (methyl methacrylate) surfactant. Based onCMP experiments, they reported that particles synthesized at loweroxygen concentration included hexagonal structure (Ce\n2O3), broke\ndown more easily during milling and agglomerated to larger sizes inslurries, and yielded lower oxide RR and higher defectivity (in terms\nof residual particles and number of scratches). The effect of two step\ncalcination and milling with different sized beads (0.2 to 0.8 mm) onremoval rate and defectivity was also investigated.\n70The two step cal-\ncination (680\u25e6C / 580\u25e6C) and milling with 0.3 mm beads resulted in\na slurry with minimal defects and acceptable selectivity (\u223c37). Theseresults suggest that synthesis method of the ceria particles has a strongeffect on polishing performance.\nEarlier, Carter and Johns\n29,49measured the removal rates of silicon\ndioxide and silicon nitride in 0.5 wt% ceria (mean particle size of\u223c120 nm) based slurries with many organic additives, at pH 5. Amongthe additives, glutamic acid, picolinic acid, 4-hydroxybenxoic acid andImidazole showed a selectivity of more than 100 while slurries withproline showed a selectivity of only 3. This contrasts sharply withthe earlier reports by Srinivasan et al.\n42\u201346and America and Babu28\nthat showed much higher selectivity at pH 6 and higher. They usedcalcined ceria particles (avg. size \u223c180 nm, Ferro corp.) while Carter\nand Johns did not report the synthesis method. The difference between\nthese results suggests that the synthesis method and/or the purity ofthe abrasives may have played a role.\nPraveen et al.\n71also showed that the calcination temperature of\nsynthesized ceria particles and the associated crystallite size impact\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract).\u00a0 ecsdl.org/site/terms_use  address.

XRD analyses of the abrasives suggest that the\ncrystallite size is positively correlated to the calcination temperature.\nSimilarly, Kim et al.72found that the oxide RRs obtained using cal-\ncined ceria abrasives (crystallite size \u223c46 nm) were higher than those\nwith precipitated particles (average size \u223c34 nm) and assigned the\nenhanced RR to the larger crystallite size of the calcined ceria.\nRecently, Doi et al.73observed that the addition of picolonic acid to\ncolloidal ceria (mean dia \u223c69 nm) enhanced the removal rates from\n\u223c150 nm/min to 370 nm/min at pH 4.5, but lower than the \u223c400\nnm/min obtained with almost the same size calcined ceria (Figure 6).\nSince the particle sizes were the same for both colloidal and calcinedceria, the synthesis method appears to strongly in\ufb02uence the oxideremoval behavior. Their XPS data showed that the Ce\n3+to Ce4+ratio\n01020304050\n050100\n300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\nCrystallite size (nm)) n i m / m n ( R R e d ix o i d n o c i l S\nTemperature (\u00b0C)RR\ncrystallite size\nFigure 5. Silicon dioxide RR in slurries containing 0.25 wt% ceria abra-\nsives synthesized at different calcination temperatures. Adapted from Praveen\net al.71on the polished silicon dioxide \ufb01lms increased when picolinic acid was\nadded. They speculated that picolinic acid might assist the chemicalreaction between Ce\n3+and silicon dioxide rather than increase the\nnumber of Ce3+on the ceria particles or in the slurry.\nNot only the method of preparation but also the associated impuri-\nties in the ceria particles seem to play a role on STI performance. For\nexample, Praveen et al.71compared the selectivity obtained in slurries\ncontaining either L-proline or L-glutamic acid with ceria abrasives\nfrom three different sources: Sigma Aldrich (ceria-SA), Sodiff, Korea(ceria-S) and ceria prepared by calcination of Ce\n2(CO 3)3followed by\nmilling (ceria-CM). The ceria-SA and ceria-S abrasives, but not ceria-CM, were found to contain La as an impurity. The results showed thatwith L-glutamic acid as the additive, all the slurries yielded high se-lectivity, while with L-proline, only slurries with pure ceria abrasivesyielded high selectivity.\nLa doping in CeO\n2is expected to increase the oxygen vacancies\nand also \u2018pin\u2019 them, restraining the vacancies from migrating.74Gillis\net al.75reported that La atoms doped in CeO 2tend to migrate to\nthe surface. Taken together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that La dopingwill increase the oxygen vacancies at the surface and those vacancieswould not migrate, thus permanently changing the surface state. Theincrease in oxygen vacancies on the particle surface would tend toincrease the fraction of Ce\n3+on the surface. Thus it appears that both\nthe synthesis method and purity level of ceria abrasive can strongly\nin\ufb02uence its polishing characteristics.\nReactivity of ceria.\u2014 Ceria based slurries are believed to chemi-\ncally interact with SiO 2and yield high RR, and the initially, Ce4+was\nproposed as the reactive species.13Subsequent investigations suggest\nthat Ce3+is likely to be the reactive species. The relevant reports are\nsummarized below. Based on UV-visible absorption spectra, Veera\nDandu et al.15identi\ufb01ed that the primary species on the ceria surface\nresponsible for the high reactivity with silica are likely to be Ce3+\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract).\u00a0 ecsdl.org/site/terms_use  address.

The absorption spectra of Ce3+and Ce4+show clearly differ-\nent signatures and are dependent on pH. They analyzed the \ufb01ltrates\nprepared from ceria dispersions and showed that the ions present insolution are Ce\n3+. In addition, when additives such as PVP or PAD\n(which suppress oxide RR in ceria slurries) are present in the slurry,the spectra showed that the \ufb01ltrate did not contain Ce\n3+. This shows\nthat Ce3+is the species likely to interact with oxide \ufb01lm, and that PVP\nand PAD block the Ce3+sites, thereby inhibiting oxide removal.\nRecently, Veera Dandu et al.76measured the oxide and nitride RRs\nin ceria slurries with controlled dissolved oxygen content (DOC) inthe pH range of 2 to 12 (Figures 7aand7b). At pH <4, the oxide and\nnitride RRs were low, regardless of DOC. In the pH range of 4\u201312,\nthe oxide and nitride RRs were high and more or less independentof pH, for a given DOC. In this pH range, the oxide and nitride RRsdecreased with an increase in DOC. In another report, Manivannanand Ramanathan\n77showed that the addition of H 2O2to ceria slurries\ncaused a drastic reduction in oxide and nitride RRs in the pH range\nof 7\u201310. Both these sets of results could be explained if Ce3+is\nthe active site, which would be converted to Ce4+(assumed to be\nless active) at higher DOC or by the addition of H 2O2. They also\nshowed that if the ceria treated with H 2O2is \ufb01ltered and redispersed\nin water (without adding H 2O2), then the oxide and nitride RR were\nnot suppressed, indicating that the conversion of Ce3+to Ce4+in an\noxidizing environment is reversible.\nSeveral published reports about the role of oxygen vacancies sup-\nport this proposition. Deshpande et al.78and Dutta et al.7,9among\nothers, have shown that ceria nanoparticles have Ce3+on the surface\nand that oxygen vacancies drive the formation of Ce3+from Ce4+.\nBased on DFT calculations, Preda et al.80proposed that, on the sur-\nface of a ceria particle, a Ce3+site with an oxygen vacancy can interactwith molecular oxygen and can possibly form two species, a Ce4+su-\nperoxo species or a Ce3+peroxo species (Figure 8). With increasing\nDOC in the slurry, it is likely that the Ce3+sites with oxygen vacancies\nare converted to one of these two forms, leading to a reduction in the\nRR since only the Ce3+with an oxygen vacancy, and not the super-\noxo and peroxo species, is the reactive site. Using DFT corrected for\nonsite coulomb interactions, Yeriskin and Nolan81studied the effect\nof La doping on ceria surface. They showed that La3+substitution of\nCe4+results in an oxygen vacancy, which results in the production\nof one Ce3+. Patil et al.82synthesized ceria nanoparticles ( \u223c3t o5\nnm) with controlled La and Nd doping by a microemulsion process.The particles were analyzed using XRD and Raman spectroscopy andthey showed that the lattice parameter and defect concentration in-creased with La doping. They proposed that substitution of Ce\n4+by\nLa3+causes introduction of oxygen vacancies and partial reduction of\nneighboring Ce4+to Ce3+. These results are similar to those of Gillis\net al.75with larger ceria particles.\nModi\ufb01cation of ceria particles.\u2014 Even though ceria abrasives\nare prone to generate more post-CMP defects compared to colloidal\nsilica,83they have certain inherent advantages such as higher through-\nput, lower particle loading, initial cost, and perhaps lower post-CMP\nwaste disposal costs. Hence, novel design concepts that can minimize\nthe challenges without sacri\ufb01cing the advantages are continually be-\ning developed and evaluated. One example, though for silica particles,is the phosphate functionalized particles described earlier.\n67A more\nimportant example is the usage of slurries containing a mixture ofceria and other abrasives as well as core/shell type particles madeof an external ceria coating. Some examples are described below todemonstrate the potential of such an approach.\n0200400600800\n2468 1 0 1 2Oxide RR (nm/min)\npHDOC ~8.6 mg/L\nDOC ~12.1 mg/L\nDOC~16.6 mg/L\n0255075100125150\n2468 1 0 1 2Nitride RR (nm/min)\npHDOC~8.6 mg/L\nDOC~12.1 mg/L\nDOC~16.6 mg/L\n(b) (a)\nFigure 7.

Possible reaction pathways showing the formation of peroxo and superoxo complexes of Ce3+at higher DOC values. The concentration of Ce3+species\nwith the oxygen vacancy, the reactive sites, drops in the presence of O 2. Hence oxide and nitride RR decrease when DOC is increased.\nJindal et al.84showed that the RRs of oxide increased with ceria\ncoated alumina-based slurries when compared to RRs obtained with\neither ceria- or silica-based dispersions, but defectivity data were notreported. Lee et al.\n85synthesized silica particles coated with ceria and\nfound that the oxide RR obtained using a ceria coated silica slurry wassigni\ufb01cantly higher than that in the pure abrasive slurries. Lu et al.\n86\nevaluated the polishing performance of silica, ceria and hematite abra-sives, in single abrasive mode, (binary) mixed abrasive mode and innano-particle coated abrasive mode. The ceria particles were relativelysmall (\u223c20 nm), while the silica particles were spherical ( \u223c400 nm).\nHematite particles were synthesized in two shapes, viz. ellipsoidal\n(\u223c400 nm) and cubic (\u223c750 nm). Nanosized ceria and silica ( \u223c20\nnm) abrasives yielded negligible oxide RRs and slurries with only sil-\nica or hematite showed very low (17-18 nm/min) oxide RRs. Hematitebased mixed abrasives, on the other hand, showed higher oxide RRs.Silica or hematite abrasives coated with ceria produced even higheroxide RRs. They also showed that adding ceria abrasives to a \ufb01xedabrasive pad can dramatically increase the oxide RR. The authorssuggested that the mixed abrasives and the coated abrasives synergis-tically utilize the reactivity of the ceria and the increased contact areabetween the wafer and the abrasive to enhance the oxide RRs.\nPark et al.\n87investigated the oxide RR in zirconia and silica mixed\nabrasive slurries. Dilution of pure silica slurry resulted in lowering of\noxide RR but addition of zirconia increased the oxide RR to originalvalues. The WIW uniformity of the RR was also comparable to theoriginal silica slurry results. The main advantage of this mixed abra-sive system was the lower cost compared to the original silica slurrycost.\nArmini et al.\n83synthesized two types of composite abrasives with a\n300 nm polymer core coated \u223c14 nm ceria particles, one achieved with\na silane coupling agents and the other with electrostatic interactionsbetween the core and the shell. They reported that the two compositeabrasive-based slurries exhibit different RRs, probably due to thedifference in morphology and surface composition. More importantly,they showed that these composite particles exhibit lower defects whencompared to conventional slurries, probably due to spring like effect ofthe softer elastic core during polishing. Lee et al.\n88evaluated a slurry\nwith ceria and silica abrasives and showed that it gave reasonable\noxide RRs, acceptable RR selectivity, good slurry stability, and lowsurface defects. While the reduction in defect level is important, otherfactors such as slurry stability, shelf-life and performance consistencyalso need to be evaluated before these mixed or composite abrasivesare employed in production. There are several other reports of usingmixed abrasive or core/shell particles in slurry formulation, for STICMP as well as metal and barrier CMP.\n89\u201398CMP of Patterned STI Structures\nWhile planarization of patterned structures is all important, most\nof the published data are from blanket wafer \ufb01lm polishing and, as is\nwidely known, these rates do not carry over to patterned structures.This poses a real challenge for developing in a cost-effective mannerslurries for planarizing STI structures. Also, the results of polish-ing pattern wafers using different slurries, while available to mostpracticing engineers in the industry, are not widely available in thepublic domain, undoubtedly due to the associated intellectual propertyrights. As stated earlier, extent of nitride and \ufb01eld oxide loss, dish-ing, response to almost always required overpolish, WIW and WIDuniformity, and defects - and not just selectivity - are some of the crit-ical metrics for evaluating the performance of a slurry in conjunctionwith several other associate process variables. A few publications doaddress some of these issues and are summarized below.\nKim et al.\n99polished both blanket and patterned wafers using silica\nbased slurries and reported that the oxide removal rates in both are\nstrongly correlated. Later Kim et al.100employed a high selectivity sil-\nica based slurry, developed in house, to polish patterned structures and\nobtained signi\ufb01cantly less variability in post CMP thickness valuesby using end point detection based on monitoring the motor currentinstead of polishing for a predetermined time and found that there is a\nstrong correlation between the two RRs. In both cases, the selectivity\ndata were not reported.\nLim et al.\n101evaluated the effect of ceria abrasive size on the\ndishing and step height reduction during STI CMP. Ceria abrasivesof three different particles sizes (primary particle sizes of 45 nm,175 nm and 225 nm) were dispersed in DI water at pH 6.7. Thedishing and step height reduction in trenches of about 10 micronwidth were measured using atomic force microscopy. The step heightreduction was less initially but it increased at longer polishing times.This was attributed to the abrasives particles trapped in the trenches.The slurry with larger particles yielded quicker step height reductionand larger removal rates. At suf\ufb01ciently long times, all the slurriesresulted in complete step height reduction. However, the extent ofdishing increased with over polishing time, as expected, and it alsoincreased slightly with the size of the abrasive.\nMerricks et al.\n102compared the removal rates of silicon dioxide\nand silicon nitride as a function of time in ceria based slurries with two\ndifferent additives, an unspeci\ufb01ed amino acid and poly acrylic acid(PAA). In both case, the selectivity on pattern wafers was lower thanwhat would be predicted from blanket \ufb01lm data. They found that, intheir case, after the initial nitride \ufb01lm exposure, another 30s overpolishwas needed to clear the oxide from the rest of the wafer during which\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract).\u00a0 ecsdl.org/site/terms_use  address.

Hence, the dishing was considerably higher and WIWand WID considerably worse for the PAA containing slurry. With theamino acid based slurry, removal of the silicon nitride \ufb01lm occurredonly in the initial \u223c6s or so, supposedly the time required for the amino\nacid functional groups to equilibrate on the nitride surface. There wasvery little oxide as well as nitride loss afterwards, leading to a 1:1RR ratio and, hence, no increase in dishing and no detrimental effectsfrom overpolishing on WIW an WID uniformity, characteristics thatare highly desirable in a slurry for pattern structure planarization.\nYang et al.\n103compared the polishing performance of three kinds\nof ceria and four kinds of silica slurries. The effect of particle sizeand shape on the step height reduction of rectangular ( \u223c100 nm\nsize) and saw tooth ( \u223c500 nm pitch) patterns was studied. Based\non the analysis of the results, they concluded that smaller sized andspherically shaped ceria particles are more effective in step height\nreduction. Euvrard et al.\n60evaluated the effect of selectivity on dishing,\nbut using slurries with low selectivity (\u223c1). They compared the results\nfrom blanket wafers with those from patterned wafers and concluded\nthat the selectivity is higher for the patterned wafers. However, sincethe mechanism of \ufb01lm removal in a high selectivity slurry differsvastly from that of a low selectivity slurry, this conclusions maynot apply to high selectivity slurries. Kim et al.\n104showed that step\nheight reduction, or planarization, was better with ceria-based slurriescontaining proline and serine over that obtained with glutamine andamino butyric acid. They proposed that a stronger interaction betweenthe oxide and proline or serine, which they calculated from standardDLVO theory, is the cause of improved step height reduction.\nLiao et al.\n105investigated the importance of pad surface topogra-\nphy in STI CMP using patterned wafers with varying pattern densities\n(10% to 90%), all with 100 micron pitch. They employed two condi-tioners and a mixture of commercial slurries from Hitachi. All yieldedroughly similar RRs but vastly different dishing and erosion values.They suggested that the conditioners that generate more and sharperpad asperities can increase dishing and erosion by more than 100%in most features, presumably due to the direct contact of the downfeatures with the sharp asperities.\nSeo et al.\n106found that the step height changes can be tuned\nby controlling the adhesive force between ceria abrasives andthe polyurethane pad when they used picolinic acid based ceriadispersions at pH 4.5 to polish 500 nm wide patterns. The step height\nreduction, measured as a function of polish time in slurries with\nand without picolinic acid, was signi\ufb01cantly better in slurries withpicolinic acid. They proposed that picolinic acid covers the ceriaabrasive surface and helps with the attachment of ceria particles to thepad, which helps in the reduction of step height. Later, Seo et al.\n107\ninvestigated the effect of adding both PAA and poly (ethylene glycol)(PEG) to ceria based slurries at pH 5 to polish patterned wafers with100 micron wide lines at various pattern densities (37.5% to 75%)and showed that the combination enhanced selectivity and reduceddishing. Without the additives, the selectivity was moderate ( \u223c56)\nand the dishing was approximately 800 \u00c5 and 200 \u00c5, respectively, forlines with a pattern density of 37.5% and 75%, and were reduced to\nabout 600 \u00c5 and 100 \u00c5, respectively, in the presence of 0.8 wt% PAA\nand 0.3 wt% PEG. They suggested that hydrogen bonding facilitatesthe adsorption of PAA on silicon nitride which suppresses nitride re-moval and enhances selectivity as well as the formation of PAA-PEG\u201cinterpolymer complexes\u201d that reduce dishing by preventing oxideabrasion.\nClearly, the data needed to evaluate the performance of an STI\nslurry, indeed, any CMP process slurry for that matter, are more ex-\ntensive and differ in many ways from those that can be obtained fromblanket wafer \ufb01lm polishing. They also depend critically on the na-ture and morphology of the polishing pad, the polishing tool and theassociated tool parameters. As such, enormous resources, includingthose needed to cover the cost of expensive patterned wafers, have tobe allocated to validate and accept a slurry for large volume manu-facturing and can indeed act as a barrier to entry for newer candidateslurries.Current Challenges\nWhile enormous progress has been achieved as described above\nand continues, several challenges remain. Only a couple of these \u2013\ndefect reduction and new dielectric materials - are addressed below.\nDefect reduction.\u2014 CMP (dielectric or metal) process-induced de-\nfects can be classi\ufb01ed broadly as micro scratches, gouges and pits,\ndishing, residual particles and organic residues. Any of these defectsin STI CMP can result in yield loss and, hence, their reduction, andpreferably elimination, is a key challenge.\n108Indeed,this is an over-\narching and overriding concern for maintaining yields and remains atthe top of the list of performance metrics. An effective CMP processis one that minimizes defects and facilitates post-CMP processingto remove all contaminants from the post-polished surfaces. A typi-cal commercial ceria-based slurry may contain large and/or irregularshaped particles which are more likely to cause many defects. Pointof use \ufb01ltration can prevent \u201clarge particles\u201d from reaching the pol-\nish tool or the wafer surface and help in defect reduction\n109,110and,\nconsequently, online real time particle monitoring and feedback has\ngained considerable importance. Since it is known that slurries basedon small and relatively narrow size-dispersed spherical ceria particlescan lower defects, a judicious selection of ceria particle size and/orperhaps using a \u201cmixture\u201d of narrow sized silica and ceria can alsohelp in reducing the defect levels without sacri\ufb01cing oxide RR andselectivity.\n83,111\nHigh selectivity or nitride rate suppression is, in principle, needed\nonly at the last stage of removing the oxide overburden when silicon\nnitride surface is \ufb01rst exposed and overpolishing is used to removeresidual oxide. In Cu CMP, the process is usually carried out in twosteps: the \ufb01rst stage CMP when the bulk of the Cu is removed andthe second stage soft landing step to remove the residual Cu followedby or concurrently removing the barrier layer. Similarly, it may bepossible to remove the bulk of the silicon dioxide using a ceria basedslurry with high oxide rate irrespective of the nitride rate and the\ufb01nal polish may be performed with a slurry with moderate or highselectivity that can minimize dishing, result in a good WIW and WIDuniformity, low defect levels and a facile post CMP clean process.In any case, since any residual oxide will prevent the etching of theunderlying nitride and hence interfere with the exposure of the activesilicon region, some degree of overpolishing is commonly used, butat the cost of increased \ufb01lm thickness nonuniformity. Another optionis to remove the residual oxide using a dilute HF etch but, as is well\nknown, this will grow and expand/decorate even the smallest of the\nscratches that may be present in the oxide \u2013 a critical concern.\nThe drive toward \u2018green chemicals\u2019 leads to utilization of bio-\ncompatible additives in the slurry but this can simultaneously lead tobio-contamination in the slurry storage or transport channels and/orpolishing equipment and hence on the wafer. This challenge is usu-ally overcome by including biocides in the slurry. Additionally, as theuse of smaller and smaller abrasive particles is gaining importance,their potential environmental importance must be investigated and allrisks must be eliminated.\n112Since slurry formulations remain propri-\netary and dynamic, there is a need to collaboratively develop newapproaches to properly dispose the used slurry to eliminate any riskin the work place or the environment.\n112The potential toxicity of the\nabrasives by themselves and in their modi\ufb01ed form in the post-CMPdispersions, especially when they are at the nanoscale, is a seriousconcern and mandates stringent safe handling procedures that mustbecome an integral part of their use.\nDielectrics other than silicon dioxide.\u2014 Silicon carbonitride has\nbeen evaluated as a dielectric diffusion barrier\n113and its incorporation\nrequires a CMP step with a high silicon carbontride RR and a low\nsilicon dioxide RR. It is possible that similar materials such as siliconoxynitride or silicon oxycarbide may also be used as the dielectricin different STI integration schemes.\n113Introduction of these or other\nnew materials will require new slurries as well as reoptimization of theentire process recipe.

Also, for\nmaterials such as silicon oxynitride used with an underlying siliconnitride stop layer, the difference in optical properties may not besuf\ufb01ciently large for the optical method to identify the end point. Onemay have to rely on \ufb02uorescence\n115or temperature116as a parameter\nto identify the end point.\nThe challenges discussed here represent only the tip of the iceberg.\nMany more challenges exist but given the historical evolution of theCMP processes, the industry has been ef\ufb01cient and highly innovativein overcoming many such challenges at earlier nodes and there is noreason to believe that the trend will not persist.\nConclusions\nCMP is ubiquitous in the semiconductor industry and has become\nincreasingly integral to an ever growing number of process integrationschemes involving novel materials. Speci\ufb01cally, STI process integra-tion employs the CMP process to planarize the trench dielectric usingusually a ceria based slurry and process combinations that generate arelatively high oxide rate polish rate with minimal nitride loss or highrate selectivity, as well as reduced dishing, erosion, WIW and WID\nnonuniformity and other defects.\nThe desired high selectivity is achieved mostly with ceria based\nslurries admixed with suitable additives. The additives are essential\nto suppress the nitride RRs while maintaining the oxide RRs at ac-ceptable levels. The results presented in patents and published articlesreviewed here have brought some clarity to the understanding of thenitride rate suppression mechanism. Additives such as amino acids,if available in suf\ufb01cient quantities, and at the correct pH range wherethey remain protonated, can adsorb on the silicon nitride surface andprevent the hydrolysis of the silicon nitride surface and reduce itsremoval rate.\nCeria chemically interacts with the SiO\n2surface, and although the\nreactivity of ceria toward the silicon dioxide has been well known,the actual mechanism is only now emerging. Based on many recentexperiments as well several \ufb01rst principle calculations, it appears thatCe\n3+stabilized by an oxygen vacancy on the surface of ceria particles\nis the primary reactive species that interacts and polishes the oxide\n\ufb01lm. Among other results, the reduction in silicon dioxide and siliconnitride RR at various pH levels, with increasing dissolved oxygen con-tent of ceria slurries suggests a role for molecular oxygen to transformthese Ce\n3+species into less reactive ones. The ceria abrasive synthesis\nprocess conditions that impact crystallite size, morphology and purityhave a strong effect on the polishing characteristics. Also, precipitatedand calcined ceria behave differently. The abrasive purity also appearsto be important in determining the selectivity. Impurities such as La\nin the abrasive can drastically change the polishing behavior, at least\nin case of some additives such as proline. All these parameters seemto impact the concentration of the surface Ce\n3species and, because of\nit, the oxide polish rate.\nCeria based slurries can generate more defects than silica based\nslurries, but they also yield higher selectivity and removal rates thatenable high wafer throughputs. Innovations such as cost-effectivemonodispersed and/or smaller and spherical ceria abrasives, or theusage of mixed, composite, core/shell or other functional abrasiveslurries with appropriate additive/s can assist in reducing the defectlevels while maintaining throughput and selectivity. Introduction ofnew materials such as silicon oxynitride, silicon carbonitride or siliconoxycarbide in the STI structure complicates slurry and process devel-opment as well as end point detection. A high silicon nitride RR witha low silicon dioxide RR (i.e. reverse selectivity) is useful in certainprocess steps, for example, during the front end 3D-gate processing.Such reverse selectivity can be achieved by adding suitable chemicalssuch as PEI, PDADMAC, PVP and PAD. The additives such as PVPor PAD can block the active Ce\n3+sites on the abrasive and suppress\nthe removal of silicon dioxide. Also, silica abrasives can be modi\ufb01edby grafting phosphate functional groups and the resulting abrasivesselectivity polish nitride over oxide, mainly because of the interactionof the phosphate group with the nitride surface, bust cost is a barrier.\nOther major challenges facing the industry in the usage of high\nselectivity STI CMP slurries include the ability to predict performance\nof patterned structures with different pattern densities and featuresizes from blanket wafer \ufb01lm rate data and reduction in defect levelsincluding WIW and WID non-uniformity, end point detection andtreatment and disposal of used slurry. The effect of nanoparticles inthe slurry on the environment is an emerging and growing concernrequiring effective treatment and disposal of the ef\ufb02uent from theCMP process.\nIn conclusion, CMP technology, in general, has undergone remark-\nable evolution in sophistication, complexity and utilization over the\nyears while remaining far ahead of the understanding of the underly-ing fundamental principles \u2013 something that is not likely to change inthe near future.\nReferences\n1.

This work mainly reviews the polishing \nmechanism of cerium oxide, the factors affecting the CMP rate and the improvement methods. In the aspect of \nCMP cleaning, the introduction of additives, water cleaning, chemical cleaning and other cleaning methods are \nsummarized. On this basis, some suggestions were proposed to provide valuable references for the STI CMP and \npost cleaning based on cerium oxide abrasive.   \n1.Introduction \nIn advanced integrated circuit manufacturing processes, dielectric \nmaterials are commonly used for electrolyte insulation, surface passiv -\nation, diffusion masking [1], and reducing RC delay [2]. The dielectric \nmaterials used mainly include silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, high k/low \nk dielectrics, etc. Silicon dioxide is widely used in the field of integrated \ncircuit manufacturing due to its low cost, easy preparation, excellent \ndielectric properties, and good process compatibility. It is usually used \nas an insulation layer, dielectric isolation, protective layer, passivation \nlayer, gate oxide layer, or diffusion mask layer. With the development of \nNAND (Negative-AND) flash memory technology, it is difficult for \nplanar lithography technology to continue to be suitable for the expo-\nnential growth of sensing area. The 3D stacking technology using the \netching process has been widely adopted due to its advantages of high \ndensity, good performance and low cost. Fig. 1 shows (a) pipe-shaped \nbit-cost-scalable (P-BiCS) and (b) terabit-cell-array transistor (TCAT) \nfor 3D NAND, respectively. Typically, silicon nitride is used as a charge \ntrapping layer (CTL) to store charges, while silicon oxide or alumina is \nused as a barrier oxide (BOX) layer [3]. As can be seen from the NAND \nstructure, isolation processes are essential. The traditional local oxida -\ntion of silicon (LOCOS) process is a commonly used isolation technology \nin the manufacturing of complementary metal oxide semiconductor \n(CMOS). However, the conventional LOCOS process is greatly limited \ndue to the fact that oxygen diffused into silicon dioxide will come into \ncontact with the silicon on the side, leading to field oxygen erosion in the \ndirection of the active area and causing the \"beak effect\" [4]. This \nproblem is well solved by the shallow trench isolation (STI) process, \nmainly including etching grooves on the silicon substrate, oxide filling \nand oxide flattening to achieve isolation of the active area, as shown in  \nFig. 2 [5]. Because STI technology can achieve smaller isolation spacing \nand superior latch protection, it is widely used in technology nodes of \n0.25 \u00b5m and below. \nIn the STI process, the flattening of oxides is a particularly important \npart, as shown in Fig. 2(d). At this point, the silicon nitride on the silicon surface acts as a barrier layer to prevent damage to important surfaces \nduring planarization and epitaxial growth processes. When performing \noxide flattening, it is necessary to retain silicon nitride while removing \nthe silica. Therefore, the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process \nof STI should not only consider the surface morphology and polishing \nFig. 1.Y-Z cross view of CT-based NAND [3].  \nFig. 2.A schematic representation of the STI Process. Note that the dielectric, \ndenoted by D, may be pure or other forms of SiO2.

X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n3rate, but also consider the removal rate selection ratio of silicon dioxide \nand silicon nitride. As the feature size of semiconductor technology \ncontinues to decrease, STI technology requires abrasives for CMP (as \nshown in Fig. 2d) process to have high selectivity and low defect levels \nwhile guaranteeing high polishing rates. In order to meet the process \nrequirements, the removal rate selection ratio of silica and silicon nitride \nneeds to be 30:1. In the absence of any additives, the removal rate se-\nlection ratio of silica and silicon nitride polished with the slurry con-\ntaining cerium oxide, alumina, silica and silicon carbide abrasives was \ncompared [6]. At the same speed and pressure, the slurry containing \ncerium oxide abrasive can achieve the highest removal rate of silica, and \nthe highest selection ratio of silica and silicon nitride. Therefore, for the \nSTI process, cerium oxide abrasive becomes a preferred choice for the \noxide planarization. \nCerium oxide is a fluorite oxide with a face-centered cubic crystal \nstructure, as shown in Fig. 3 [7], with each cerium atom surrounded by \neight oxygen atoms. Since cerium ions in cerium oxide can finish \nreversible electron transfer between the two valence states (Ce3\u0087and \nCe4\u0087), oxygen vacancies are formed in the lattice, that is, the appearance \nof Ce3\u0087must be accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies, \nwhich contributes to the formation of CeO 2 and CeO 2\u0000x. This property \nalso endows cerium oxide nanoparticles with redox ability, which can be \nused as catalysts for oxidation or reduction reaction. The strength of \nredox capacity is closely related to the concentration of oxygen va-\ncancies, which can be reflected by the determination of Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087in \ncerium oxide, or quantified by oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [8], which \nis the number of moles of oxygen released per gram of the initial ma-\nterial. The redox capacity of cerium oxide can be controlled by changing \nits surface properties, particle size, particle shape, and preparation \nprocess. \nDue to its redox properties, cerium oxide can be used in catalysts [9], \nfuel cell electrolytes [10], automobile exhaust cleaning agents [11], \nbiomedicine [12], chemical mechanical polishing [13] and other fields. \nWith the decreasing of feature size in integrated circuits, the re-\nquirements for the removal rate of oxide layer and surface quality are \nalso increasing. How to obtain a wafer surface with fewer defects and \nlower roughness under the premise of high polishing rate and selectivity \nis a problem worth exploring. In addition, the removal of residue cerium \noxide particles after polishing is also the focus of current research. \nBecause residual particle will lead to uneven morphology of the micro \nareas on the wafer surface, affecting lithography accuracy, and even \nchip failure. How to remove cerium oxide particles without damaging \nthe wafer surface is also one of the key issues that need to be paid \nattention to. \nIn this article, the research progress of cerium oxide in the field of \nCMP was reviewed. Firstly, the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide is \nintroduced, with the formation of Ce-O-Si bonds being the main role. \nSubsequently, the effects of particle size, the ratio of Ce3\u0087to Ce4\u0087and surface modification of ceria on polishing performance were analyzed, \nwith a focus on methods to improve the polishing performance, \nincluding improving the removal rate selection ratio of silica to silicon \nnitride, as well as solving the existing problems of dishing, surface \nuniformity after polishing. Finally, the current cleaning methods for \ndielectric materials polished with cerium oxide were introduced, mainly \nincluding acid cleaning solution and alkaline cleaning solution, as well \nas their improvement methods. This will provide reference for \nimproving the performance of dielectric CMP and post-polishing \ncleaning based on cerium oxide abrasive in IC manufacturing processes. \n2.Correlation mechanism between CeO 2 abrasive and SiO2 \ndielectric layer \nThe particle size, Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087value and surface properties of ceria \nabrasives will affect polishing performance such as the polishing rate, \nsurface morphology, and selectivity. Therefore, the research progress in \nthese aspects is summarized and suggestions for improving polishing \nperformance are proposed. \nCMP is a particularly important part of integrated circuit \nmanufacturing process. CMP treatment of wafer surface can greatly \nimprove the flatness of wafer, which will affect the subsequent process. \nThe process of polishing the fused silica surface with abrasives and the \nscratches caused by abrasives are shown in Fig. 4[14] . The fused silica \nadhered to the polishing head is placed on the polishing pad under a \ncertain pressure, and the polishing head rotates at a constant speed, \nwhile the polishing slurry drops on the polishing pad at a certain speed. \nIn this process, the abrasive will leave certain scratches on the fused \nsilica, which should be avoided as much as possible during the polishing \nprocess. The shape and hardness of the abrasive play a decisive role in \nthe removal effect and scratch state of the material. Therefore, it is very \nimportant to find an appropriate abrasive shape to improve the polish -\ning performance. \nThe hardness of cerium oxide is 5.5, which is much lower than that of \ndiamond, alumina, silicon dioxide, etc. From the mechanical point of \nview, it is not suitable for polishing silicon dioxide, but from the \nchemical perspective, it will catalyze the hydration of the surface of \nsilicon dioxide, which is very dependent on water. The interaction be-\ntween the SiO2 surface and water is one of the main steps of polishing \nprocess. Hydration steps are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) [7]: \n\u0000SiO 2\u0087H2O\u2192\u0000Si\u0000OH\u2192\u0000Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087H\u0087(1)  \n\u0000Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087Ce\u0000OH\u2192\u0000Si\u0000O\u0000Ce\u0000\u0087OH\u0000(2) \nThe hydrated silica film is much softer than before, making it more \nsuitable for removal. At the same time, due to the low hardness of the \nmaterial, it is not easy to scratch the surface of the material in the pol-\nishing process. In 1990, COOK et al. [15] first proposed the concept of \nFig. 3.Structural analysis of ceria crystals and unit cells. Eight-fold coordinated cerium atoms (yellow) with four-fold coordinated oxygen atoms (red) in ceria \ncrystals (a and b) and the primitive unit cell (c) [7]. X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n4\"chemical teeth\". Cerium oxide has chemical teeth, which can accelerate \nthe breaking of chemical bonds on the surface of silicon dioxide and the \nremoval rate of reaction products is greater than the formation rate of \nsurface compound. So, cerium oxide is a good abrasive for silica CMP. \nThe following is a detailed introduction to the principle of removing \nsilica with cerium oxide. \nThe adsorption of cerium oxide on the surface of silicon oxide in-\nvolves multiple aspects, and research methods mainly include immer -\nsion and polishing. Immersion refers to soaking a silica sample in cerium \noxide slurry, so that the surface of the sample is contaminated with \ncerium oxide. Compared with immersion, polishing also involves pres-\nsure and rotation friction related to the physical properties of the pol-\nishing pad. Therefore, for these two methods, the adsorption degree of \ncerium oxide on the surface of samples is different, and it is expected \nthat the samples obtained through polishing will adsorb more cerium \noxide. Han K-M et al. [16] found through experiments that when using \nthe immersion method to contaminate samples, the samples were more \nseriously polluted at lower pH; but for polishing, the samples adsorbed \nmore particles when pH was high. And in general, the polishing process \nproduces more particle adsorption than the soaking process. Therefore, \nin order to study the action mechanism of cerium oxide in the polishing \nprocess more accurately, the following discussion mainly focuses on the \ncontamination of samples by polishing. \nCerium oxide is adsorbed on silica surface by electrostatic and \nchemical forces. The pH value at the Zeta potential of 0 is called the \nisoelectric point (IEP). Within the pH range of 3\u201311, the Zeta potential measurements of cerium oxide and TEOS (Tetraethyl orthosilicate) are \nshown in Fig. 5[16] : \nThe IEP of cerium oxide is between 7 and 8. The Zeta potential is \npositive when the pH is lower than the IEP, while it is negative when the \npH is greater than the IEP. The Zeta potential of TEOS is always negative \nand becomes more negative as the pH increases in the range of pH 3\u201311. \nTherefore, when the pH is lower than the IEP of cerium oxide, i.e., at low \npH, there is a large electrostatic attraction between cerium oxide and \nsilicon dioxide, while at high pH, there is a strong electrostatic repulsion \nbetween the two. In polishing process, there are more particles adsorbed \non the surface of samples when the pH value is high, indicating that the \neffect of electrostatic repulsion can be ignored, and chemisorption may \nbe the main reason. Under different pH conditions, the existence states \nof cerium oxide and silicon oxide are different. At lower pH, cerium \noxide exists in the form of Ce-OH2\u0087, while silicon oxide exists in the form \nof Si-OH2\u0087. At higher pH, cerium oxide exists in the form of Ce-OH or Ce- \nO-, while the silicon oxide exists in the form of Si-OH or Si-O- [17]. The \nacid-base equilibrium formula of the oxides of cerium oxide [15] and \nsilicon oxide [18] under different acid-base conditions is as follows, \nwhere pHpzc represents the pH of the solution at the zero charge point of \ncerium oxide: \nCe\u0000OH\u0087\n2\u2194Ce\u0000OH\u0087H\u0087CpHDpH pzc (3)  \nCe\u0000OH\u2194Ce\u0000O\u0000\u0087H\u0087CpHFpH pzc (4)  \nSi\u0000OH\u0087\n2\u0087H2O\u2194Si\u0000OH\u0087H3O\u0087CpKa1\u00880B2 (5)  \nSi\u0000OH\u0087H2O\u2194Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087H3O\u0087CpKa2\u00885B4 (6) \nAccording to the theory proposed by Cook L M et al. [15], in the \npolishing process, cerium compounds react with silicon compounds as \nfollows: \nCe\u0000OH\u0087Si\u0000O\u0000\u2194Ce\u0000O\u0000Si\u0087OH\u0000(7) \nIt can be seen that the formation of Ce-O-Si bonds is the main reason \nfor chemisorption. Hingston F J et al.[19] found that the degree of \nnon-specific adsorption of silicic acid and metal oxides is greater. The \nformation and deprotonation of silicic acid are shown in Formula (8): \nSiO 2\u00872H2O\u2194Si\u0085OH\u00864\u2194SiO\u0085OH\u0086\u0000\n3\u0087H\u0087(8) \nUnder different pH conditions, different cerium compounds react \nwith silicon compound SiO(OH) 3-, as shown in formula (9) - (11)[20]: \n\u0000Ce\u0000OH\u0087\n2\u0087SiO\u0085OH\u0086\u0000\n3\u2194\u0000Ce\u0000O\u0000SiO\u0085OH\u0086\u0000\n2\u0087H3O\u0087CpHDpH pzc\n(9)  \nFig. 4.Schematic illustration of CMP process and abrasive grains scratching [14].  \nFig. 5.Measured zeta potential values of ceria particles ((100 nm) and TEOS \nsubstrate as a function of pH (from 3 to 11) [16].

According to the existence forms of cerium \noxide and silicon oxide at different pH values mentioned above, the \nCe-O-Si bond formed by the two is weaker under acidic conditions, but \nstronger under alkaline conditions due to the absence of excessive acidic \nions. Therefore, under alkaline conditions, more cerium oxide particles \nwill be adsorbed on the surface of silicon oxide. \nIn addition, in order to obtain a smoother silicon oxide surface, the \ncleaning process after CMP is also particularly important. According to \nthe bonding method shown in Fig. 6, the fracture of Ce-O/Si-O bonds can \nalso be used as a breakthrough point for post CMP cleaning. \n3.Effect of CeO 2 Abrasive on the performance of dielectric CMP \n3.1. Effect of cerium oxide particle size \nGenerally, the preparation methods of cerium oxide include calci-\nnation [21], sol-gel method [22], precipitation method [23], hydro -\nthermal method [24], Solvothermal method [25], hydroxide mediated \nmethod [26], etc., of which the calcination method is the most \ncommonly used. In the production of cerium oxide, different calcination \ntemperatures will lead to different particle sizes of cerium oxide. Fig. 7 \n[13] shows the average particle size, Ce3\u0087concentration, and corre -\nsponding polishing removal rate of silicon dioxide for cerium oxide \ncalcined at different temperatures. It can be seen that the particle size of \ncerium oxide abrasive increases with the increase of calcination tem-\nperature, and the fastest increase occurs at 600\u2013800\u2103. At the same \ntime, the material removal rate (MRR) showed a trend of first increasing \nand then decreasing, with a boundary point of approximately 1000 \u2103 \nbetween the increase and decrease. It is speculated that the increase in \nMRR is due to the increase of Ce3\u0087concentration caused by the increase \nin cerium oxide particle size. The reason why the polishing rate did not \nincrease monotonically may be attributed to the decreasing of Ce3\u0087\nconcentration at too high temperature. The particle size of ceria can \naffect the MRR and surface roughness in the polishing process, both of \nwhich are the key factors in evaluating the polishing performance. \nTherefore, it is of great significance to study the influence of abrasive \nparticle size on polishing performance. \nSampurno Y et al.[27] found through experiments that the coefficient of friction (COF) and MRR of plasma-enhanced tetraethy -\nlorthosilicate (PETEOS) chips are directly related to the median particle \nsize of cerium oxide abrasives. Generally speaking, the larger the par-\nticle size of abrasive, the higher the COF value. Usually, the higher the \nCOF, the larger the corresponding MRR. Because high COF means high \nshear force, enabling the oxide film to be removed quickly. However, the \noptimal particle size was not indicated, and the roughness of polished \nsurface was not taken into consideration. In the actual production, it is \nunrealistic to blindly pursue the polishing rate. The increase in particle \nsize will lead to the increase of surface roughness. Therefore, it is sug-\ngested to determine the optimal particle size based on the surface state \nof the wafer. Oh M H et al. [28] synthesized cerium oxide particles with \ngood uniformity using the flux method. The particle size was controlled \nby changing the calcination conditions, and the main particle sizes were \n88, 166, 295 and 417nm, respectively. Using cerium oxide abrasives \nwith different particle sizes to polish silicon oxide and silicon nitride, the \nMRR shows varying degrees of increase with the increase of abrasive \nsize, so the selection ratio changes. The MRR of silica is about \n3989 \u00c5/min, while that of silicon nitride is about 127\u00c5/min using \ncerium oxide abrasive with a particle size of 295nm. In this case, the \nmaximum selection ratio is 32:1. However, the within-wafer nonuni -\nformity (WIWNU) increases with the increase of the abrasive particle \nsize. This is because as the abrasive particle size increases, the distri -\nbution of abrasive particle size in the slurry becomes wider. Different \nparticle sizes of abrasives have different fluidity on the wafer, so a wider \nparticle size distribution will result in different uniformity between the \ncenter and edge of the wafer. When the particle size is 295nm, the \nWIWNU is 14.6%. Considering MRR, removal rate selection ratio and \nWIWNU, 295nm is a good choice. This provides a reference for the \nparticle size selection of cerium oxide abrasives in practical production. \nXu G et al. [14] synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles with control -\nlable diameter and uniform shape by hydrothermal method. The particle \nsize, corresponding roughness and MRR are shown in Table 1. It can be \nseen that within a certain particle size range, the surface roughness and \nMRR are negatively correlated with the abrasive particle size, which is \ninconsistent with the previous conclusions, and it is speculated that the \nsynthesis method of cerium oxide is different. Although the MRR of \nsilicon oxide polished with cerium oxide synthesized by this method is \nlower than that using commercial cerium oxide abrasives, the surface \nroughness of the wafer is 45% lower than that samples polished with \ncommercial cerium oxide, making it more suitable for fused silica \npolishing. \nIn conclusion, the particle size of cerium oxide abrasive affects the \nperformance parameters of silicon oxide CMP such as MRR, surface \nroughness, selection ratio, WIWNU and other aspects. In most cases, the \nFig. 6.Schematic showing the ceria and oxide interactions at pH 4 and 8 [16].  X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n6particle size of cerium oxide is positively correlated with MRR, that is, \nthe larger the particle size of abrasive, the greater the MRR. However, \nthere are also completely opposite situations, which are related to the \nsynthesis of cerium oxide abrasives. Cerium oxide particles with \ndifferent sizes can be obtained by controlling the preparation conditions. \nIn the actual CMP process, excessive particle size or strong agglomera -\ntion can lead to more scratches [29], while too small particle size will \ncause more Ce residue on the surface of silica. Therefore, when deter -\nmining the particle size, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the \npossible defects that may be introduced. \n3.2. Effect of Ce3\u0087concentration \nAt present, the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide is generally \nbelieved to be that Ce3\u0087plays a major role in the polishing process. Ce3\u0087\nforms Ce-O-Si bonds by chemically interacting with silica to form Ce-O- \nSi bonds. Therefore, the concentration of Ce3\u0087has a significant influence \non MRR. In addition, it is also necessary to pay more attention to the \ninfluence of Ce3\u0087on the selection ratio and surface roughness. \nLee J et al.[30] prepared cerium oxide by hydrogen reduction. Under \nhigh temperature isothermal conditions, the reaction time and hydrogen \nconcentration are strictly controlled to prevent the agglomeration of \ncerium oxide. The hydrogen reduction process and polishing mechanism \nare shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a) (b), the number of \noxygen vacancies increases significantly, resulting in an increase in Ce3\u0087\nconcentration. Fig. 8(c) shows that the number of Ce3\u0087on the surface of \ncerium oxide significantly increases after hydrogen reduction, promot -\ning the formation of Ce-O-Si bond in the polishing process, thereby \nimproving the polishing efficiency. \nThe Ce3\u0087concentrations obtained by hydrogen at different temper -\natures are shown in Table 2, and the data in the table were obtained \nthrough X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It can be seen that the \nconcentration of Ce3\u0087increases with the increase of reaction \ntemperature. \nCerium oxide particles (main particle size: 100nm) treated by \nhydrogen reduction at different temperatures were used to polish silica, \nand the results are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen from Fig. 9(a) that MRR \nincreases with the increase of treatment temperature. As can be seen from Table 2, Ce3\u0087concentration is positively correlated with the tem-\nperature range of 400\u20131000 \u2103. Therefore, within this temperature \nrange, the higher the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the higher the MRR. As can \nbe seen from Fig. 9(b) - (e), the surface roughness does not fluctuate \nobviously, because the hydrogen reduction does not alter the basic \nphysical properties of cerium oxide. When the temperature of 1000 \u2103, \nthe concentration of Ce3\u0087increased by 12.7% and the MRR increased by \n37.7%, compared with that before reduction. However, the polishing \nperformance of ceria after hydrogen reduction at higher temperatures \nare not mentioned, so it is expected to further improve the polishing rate \nwithout reducing the surface quality. It is suspected that the reason why \nthe temperature did not increase further is that cerium oxide can \naggregate at too high temperature. \nMyong K K et al. [31] controlled the concentration of Ce3\u0087on the \nsurface of cerium oxide nanoparticles by ultrasonic treatment with \ndeionized water or 15vol% hydrogen peroxide, in which the average \nparticle size of ceria nanoparticles was 32.6 (\u00b16.1) nm. The Ce3\u0087\nconcentration before treatment was 16.3%, while after treatment it was \n21.1% (H2O2 treatment), 21.5% (ultrasonic treatment) and 25.1% \n(H2O2 and ultrasonic treatment), respectively. Therefore, the concen -\ntration of Ce3\u0087can be increased by hydrogen peroxide and ultrasonic \ntreatment. The relationship between Ce3\u0087concentration and the inter-\naction between ceria and silica was tested using AFM and QCM. It was \nfound that the higher the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the stronger the \ninteraction between them. However, the strong interaction also leads to \nthe cerium particles easily remaining on the wafer surface after CMP, \nincreasing the difficulty of cleaning after CMP. Therefore, the concen -\ntration of Ce3\u0087should be adjusted appropriately to balance the perfor -\nmance of CMP and the possible difficulties that may be encountered in \ncleaning after CMP. Netzband C et al. [32] treated cerium oxide particles \n(average particle size: 68nm) with a concentration of 1.0wt% using \ndeionized water and different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide \n(0.5\u20135wt%). The surface of silica was polished with the treated slurry \nand commercial cerium oxide abrasive (average particle size: 50nm) to \nanalyze the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration on MRR and \nsurface roughness, as shown in Fig. 10: \nWhen hydrogen peroxide concentration was 0.5wt%, both the \nmaximum MRR and the minimum surface roughness were obtained, \nwhich is very rare. Although the particle size is larger than that of \ncommercial cerium oxide, the surface roughness after polishing is \nsmaller than that of commercial cerium oxide. Furthermore, the Si3N4 \nsurface was polished with the determined optimal slurry (ceria with a \nconcentration of 1.0wt% and average particle size of 68nm, 0.5wt% \nhydrogen peroxide, pH 8), and the selection ratio of SiO2 to Si3N4 was \n3:1. Although the selectivity is superior to than that of commercial \ncerium oxide slurry, there is still a large gap compared to 30:1 selection \nratio required for the polishing process. \nFig. 7.Dependencies of the glass polishing efficiency, crystallite size, specific surface area and content of Ce3\u0087on the temperature of calcination [13].  \nTable 1 \nThe mean roughness and MRR of the corresponding particle size.  \nMean particle size (nm) Mean roughness (nm) MRR (nm/min) \n217\u00b124 0.102\u00b10.008  115.606 \n166\u00b116 0.142\u00b10.022  124.196 \n119\u00b115 0.167\u00b10.019  124.101 \n25 0.237\u00b10.044  125.342  X.

A higher concentration of Ce3\u0087may not necessarily be better, \nand the subsequent cleaning process needs to be considered. At the same \ntime, the selection ratio between SiO2 and Si3N4 should be also \nconsidered. In addition, the CMP performance of the dielectric can also be optimized through surface modification, which will be discussed in \ndetail in the next section. \n3.3. Effect of surface modification of cerium oxide \n3.3.1. Doped lanthanide metals - Physical modification \nResearch has shown that doping lanthanide metals with lower \noxidation state than Ce4\u0087can reduce the formation energy of oxygen \nvacancies in cerium oxide nanoparticles [33] and produce more oxygen \nvacancies. The structure of cerium oxide doped with neodymium(Nd) is \nshown in Fig. 11[34] . The addition of Nd causes more oxygen atoms to \nescape, forming oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies can reduce Ce4\u0087in \ncerium oxide to Ce3\u0087, resulting in a decrease of Ce4\u0087concentration and \nan increase in Ce3\u0087concentration [35]. However, not all trivalent \nlanthanide metals can increase the concentration of Ce3\u0087. Lanthanide \nmetals with positive binding energy to oxygen vacancy (Sm, Nd, etc.) \ncan increase the concentration of Ce3\u0087, while lanthanide metals with \nnegative binding energy to oxygen vacancy (Ho, Er, etc.) can reduce the \nFig. 8.Schematic illustration of the (a) crystal structure of ceria changed by hydrogen reduction, (b) process of hydrogen reduction in ceria, and (c) the polishing \nmechanism of SiO2 wafer with original and hydrogen-reduced ceria particles [30]. \nTable 2 \nCe3\u0087concentration in original ceria and ceria reduced at 400, 700, and 1000 \u2103 \ndetermined by XPS measurements.  \nTreatment \ntemperature Ce3\u0087concentration \n(%) Increase of Ce3\u0087concentration \n(%) \nOriginal  20.8 - \n400\u2103  21.4 0.6 \n700\u2103  29.1 8.3 \n1000 \u2103  33.5 12.7  X.

At the same time, adding appropriate dispersants \nsuch as polyacrylamide (PPI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyr-\nrolidone (PVP), and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), can improve the stability of doped cerium oxide. The cerium oxide doped with La/Nd/Yb \nprecipitated after one day. After adding 1vol% PVA, the prepared La/ \nNd/Yb doped cerium oxide can remain stable for up to 7 days [37]. \nCheng J et al. [38] prepared cerium oxide nanoparticles doped with 5wt \n% La, 5wt% Nd and 5wt% Yb respectively by impregnation method. \nThe experimental results showed that this doping method could promote \nFig. 9.(a) Polishing performance of SiO2 films using original ceria slurry and ceria slurry reduced by hydrogen gas at different temperatures (400 \u20131000 \u2103). 3- \ndimensional AFM images (5\u00d75\u00b5m2) of the polished wafer surface with (b) original and ceria slurry reduced at (c) 400\u2103, (d) 700\u2103, and (e) 1000 \u2103 [30]. X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n9the formation of oxygen vacancy on the surface of cerium oxide particles \nwithout affecting the surface morphology of cerium oxide, so as to \nconvert Ce4\u0087into Ce3\u0087and improve the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the TEM \ntest results of the particle surface are shown in Fig. 12. It can be seen \nfrom Fig. 12 that the impurity distribution is uniform, and the doped \nparticles are close to spherical shape, with little change compared to \nbefore doping. The CMP results show that at pH 5, the dielectric MRR \nwith doped cerium oxide nanoparticles is lower than that without doped \ncerium oxide at pH 5. At pH 9.5, the MRR of ceria nanoparticles doped \nwith La, Nd and Yb increased by 20.9 wt%, 29.6 wt% and 4.3wt%, \nrespectively, compared to undoped cerium oxide. After polishing with \ndoped cerium oxide nanoparticles, the surface roughness of silicon oxide \ndielectric is 10\u00c5, which is less than 14\u00c5 using No.2815 commercial \ncerium oxide. This provides a reference for polishing abrasives under \nalkaline conditions. However, there is no consensus on the different \nresults at different pH values. It just shows that for undoped ceria, the \nMRR of silica under acidic conditions is greater than that under alkaline \nconditions because of the coulombic force. It is speculated that for doped \nceria, the reason for the increase in MRR under alkaline conditions is the increase in Ce3\u0087concentration, but the reason for the decrease in MRR \nunder acidic conditions remains to be studied. \nKim E et al. [39] synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles by hydro -\nthermal method and doped with La or Nd with low molar concentration \nof 20% or high molar concentration of 50%, respectively. The samples \nwere marked as HTC (undoped ceria), NDC-L (ceria doped with 20% \nNd), NDC-H (ceria doped with 50% Nd), LDC-L (ceria doped with 20% \nLa), LDC-H (ceria doped with 50% La). It is found that when the pH \nrange is 4.2\u20134.5, the doped cerium oxide can significantly increase the \nMRR of silica, with a maximum value of 5000 \u00c5/min. The XPS results of \nHTC, LDC-L, and NDC-L samples are shown in Fig. 13. The Ce3\u0087con-\ncentration was calculated according to the results in Fig. 13, and the \nvalues in the three samples of HTC, LDC-L, and NDC-L were 24.54%, \n30.40% and 32.57%. Therefore, the reason for the increase in MRR is \nthat the addition of Nd or La increases the concentration of Ce3\u0087. At the \nsame time, the MRR of silicon nitride also improved, but only by a \nfraction compared to the increase in the MRR of silica. Therefore, the \nselection ratio of SiO2 and Si3N4 polished with doped cerium oxide is \nalso improved, which provides a way to improve the selectivity of silica \nto silicon nitride. The surface roughness of silica obtained by high \nconcentration Nd doping is 0.135 nm, which is lower than that of \ncommercial ceria slurry and pure ceria abrasive. Therefore, the silica \nCMP performance with high MRR, high selectivity and low surface \nroughness can be obtained using cerium oxide doped with 50% Nd. \nMa J et al. [40] studied the effect of doping different concentrations \nof La in cerium oxide at pH 9 on CMP performance. That is, the x values \nin Ce1\u0000xLaxO2 were changed to 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. The \nMRR values were 59.31\u00b19.95, 81.75\u00b113.53, 92.43\u00b116.34 and \n101.12\u00b115.37 nm/min, respectively. This is because the addition of La \nleads to the decrease in the particle size of cerium oxide, and thus \nincreasing the concentration of Ce3\u0087, which promotes the increase in \nMRR. The surface roughness after polishing is also improved. In \nconclusion, doping lanthanide metals with positive binding energy to \noxygen vacancy can improve MRR and surface quality without changing \nthe surface morphology of cerium oxide basically, and also provide a \nphysical modification approach for improving the selectivity. However, \nunder similar acidic conditions, the opposite results were obtained in the \nabove paper, which may be caused by the difference of doping con-\ncentration. The mechanism of pH changes affecting doping and Ce3\u0087\nconcentration still needs further study. \n3.3.2. Core-shell structure composite abrasives - physical modification \nCore-shell composite structure abrasives are usually composed of \nFig. 10.Controlling the Cerium Oxidation State During Silicon Oxide CMP to Improve Material Removal Rate and Roughness [32].  \nFig. 11.The atomic structure of Nd-doped CeO 2 surfaces [34].  X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n10two or more materials, including core and shell parts. According to the \ntypes of materials, they can be divided into inorganic/inorganic, inor-\nganic/organic, organic/inorganic and organic/organic materials, with \nthe former as the core material and the latter as the shell material [41]. \nThe stability of nano ceria is a challenge in the field of materials. In the \ncore-shell structures, shell materials can change the reactivity and \nthermal stability of the core material, so as to improve the stability of the whole material. At the same time, it can also improve the polishing \nperformance of cerium oxide nanoparticles [42]. \nChen Y et al. [43] synthesized polystyrene (PS)/cerium oxide abra-\nsive by chemical precipitation method. The CMP results showed that the \nMRR and root mean square (RMS) with pure ceria nanoparticles were \n208\u00b145nm/min and 0.43\u00b10.03 nm, respectively, while the values \nobtained using the PS/CeO 2 core-shell composite abrasives were 186 \n\u00b129nm/min and 0.28\u00b10.04 nm, respectively. Although the MRR \nobtained with the core-shell structure is smaller than that with pure \ncerium oxide, it is still larger than most abrasives due to the advantage of \ncerium oxide abrasives themselves. In addition, the RMS with core-shell \nstructure abrasives is 34.9% lower than that with pure cerium oxide, \nwith fewer scratches, which greatly contributes to the surface quality of \nthe polished wafer. The reason for the reduction of scratches may be that \nthe prepared composite abrasives have good structural stability. Fig. 14 \nshows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the abra-\nsives before and after CMP. It can be seen that the abrasive can still \nmaintain the spherical shape after CMP, indicating good structural sta-\nbility, which is also the main reason for the improvement of the surface \nquality after CMP. It can be explained that the improvement of CMP \nperformance with the core-shell structure abrasives is the synergistic \neffect of organic core and inorganic shell materials. In the CMP process, \nthe PS core increases the contact area between the shell abrasive and the \nwafer, thus reducing roughness and mechanical damage. \nChen A et al. [44] first prepared hexagonal mesoporous silica \n(H-mSiO 2) particles, and then obtained H-mSiO 2-CeO 2 core-shell com-\nposite structure abrasive through solution synthesis. The MRR of \n203nm/min and RMS of 0.17\u00b10.01 nm were obtained using \nH-mSiO 2-CeO 2 abrasive for dielectric CMP. The polishing efficiency and \nquality were greatly improved compared to the result obtained with \ncommercial ceria (MRR 87nm/min, RMS 0.44 nm). This may be due to \nthe low particle density of H-mSiO 2-CeO 2 abrasives, resulting in an in-\ncrease in the number of active particles and the dielectric MRR. In \naddition, the particle size of cerium oxide will decrease during the \nsynthesis process. From the previous description of the influence of \ncerium oxide particle size on polishing performance, it can be seen that a \nreduction of particle size will lead to an increase of Ce3\u0087concentration, \nthus also improving the polishing efficiency. \nFig. 12.The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of the as prepared RE (RE\u0088La, Nd and Yb)/CeO 2 \nparticles: (a) La/CeO 2; (b) Nd/CeO 2; (c) Yb/CeO 2.

Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n11It can be concluded that polishing performance, including polishing \nefficiency and surface quality can be improved by core-shell structure. \nFrom this perspective, the advantages of other composite materials can \nmake up for the lack of cerium oxide abrasives. \n3.3.3. Modifier - Chemical modification \nThe chemical modification of cerium oxide nanoparticles can in-\ncrease the cohesion, improve the dispersion, reduce the surface energy, \neliminate the surface charge, and weaken the surface polarity. The usual \napproach is to add coupling agents or surfactants [45]. \nWortman-Otto K M et al. [46] found by the UV\u2013visible spectrum that \nadditives containing carboxylic acid functional groups can inhibit the \nMRR of the oxide, such as benzoic acid (BA), glutamic acid (Glu), \n4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA). Additives containing amino acids or \nhydroxyl functional groups can promote the MRR of oxides, such as \ndextrose (Dex), PA, glycine (Gly), and hydroquinone (HQ). The inhibi -\ntion mechanism of additives with carboxylic acid functional groups is \nthat these additives have strong adsorption force on cerium oxide sur-\nface at pH 4, resulting in reduced contact between cerium oxide and the \nsurface of the wafers, thus reducing MRR. There is only a weak elec-\ntrostatic interaction between additives with amino acid functional \ngroups and cerium oxide nanoparticles. Amino acids with a ratio of 1:1 \nbetween carboxylic acid and amine can replace the binding oxygen on \nthe surface of cerium oxide to achieve the purpose of increasing \nCe3\u0087/Ce4\u0087. Dex and HQ can be used as redox reagent to regulate the \nconcentration of Ce3\u0087. However, researches based on chemical modifi -\ncation is relatively limited compared with physical modification. At \npresent, there are few reports on the surface morphology of the SiO2 \nwafer CMP with chemically modified cerium oxide. \nIn summary, the development of ceria CMP slurry needs to consider \nnot only MRR, but also the defects introduced to the wafer surface. \nUneven particle size distribution can cause an increase in WIWNU. \nStrong acid/alkaline polishing slurry can cause certain corrosion to the \nsurface of the wafer and also have a certain impact on the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple factors \nto achieve a relative balance between MRR and surface quality. In order \nto promote the industrial production of cerium oxide polishing slurry, \nsubsequent research should comprehensively improve the performance \nof the polishing slurry. A green and environmentally friendly cerium \noxide CMP slurry with high MRR, low defects, and industrial production \npotential will be the future development trend. \n4.Removal of cerium oxide particles during post CMP cleaning \nThe minimum feature size of integrated circuits has been reduced to \n7nm and below, post-CMP cleaning faces a more serious challenge of \nobtaining smooth and defect-free surfaces [47]. The most critical factor \nfor reducing the yield of silicon-based semiconductor devices is the ex-\nistence of defects [48]. Cerium oxide nanoparticles mainly play a role in \nforming strong Ce-O-Si bonds in dielectric CMP process [49], and are \neasily absorbed on the wafer surface with other pollutions after CMP, \nwhich may lead to scratches and other defects. Therefore, the cleaning of \ncerium oxide nanoparticles after CMP becomes particularly important. \nThe Ce-O-Si bonds are more easily formed on the surface of small size \nceria particles than in large size ceria particles. Therefore, most large \nsize cerium oxide particles can be removed by physical cleaning, but \nsmall size particles often need to be removed by chemical cleaning [50]. \n4.1. Introduction of additives \nKim J et al. [51] added glycerin to deionized water as an additive to \nstudy the effects of viscosity and temperature on particle removal during \npost CMP cleaning process by inductively coupled plasma mass spec-\ntrometry (ICP-MS). It was found that as the glycerin concentration \nincreased, the Ce3\u0087concentration on the cleaned wafer surface \ndecreased gradually. Therefore, the viscosity of the cleaning solution \nincreases with the increase of glycerin concentration, and the corre -\nsponding resistance to the particles also increases, which facilitates the \nremoval of cerium oxide particles. By comparing the experimental re-\nsults at 0\u2103 and 20\u2103, it is found that the lower the temperature, the \nhigher the viscosity of the cleaning solution. Glycerol can be used as an \neffective additive for removing cerium oxide particles. However, the \npaper lacks the analysis of the surface morphology of the cleaned wafers. \nThe final surface state of wafers plays a decisive role in the performance \nof semiconductor devices, so it needs to be further studied. Yan M et al. \n[52] studied the effect of adding Gly, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid \n(EDTA) and 1.2-bis-(3-aminopropylamino) ethylenediamine (TAD) to \nthe cleaning solution on the removal of residual cerium oxide after \npolishing. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) after \ncleaning are shown in Fig. 15. It was found that when 0.15 wt% EDTA \nwas added into the cleaning solution with pH 11, the particle removal \nefficiency (PRE) reached the highest (99%), and the surface roughness \ndecreased to 0.45 nm. The PRE of the cleaning solution with Gly and \nTAD added was 96.8% and 93.8%, respectively, and the surface \nroughness was 0.95 nm and 1.41 nm, respectively. Through the analysis \nof the mechanism of action, it was found that EDTA broke the Si-O bond \nthrough the downward cutting effect of carboxyl functional groups in \nEDTA, and formed a soluble complex with Ce3\u0087through the complexa -\ntion reaction. \nTherefore, glycerin or complexing agents containing carboxyl func-\ntional groups can be added to the cleaning solution to increase PRE of \nceria in the cleaning process and obtain better surface morphology. \n4.2. Water cleaning \nYun J et al. [53] improved the polishing and cleaning process by first \npolishing with cerium oxide slurry, and then polishing and cleaning the \nwafer simultaneously with remaining cerium oxide slurry on pad and \ndeionized water (DIW), referred to as the ceria/DIW combined process. \nThe process steps are shown in Fig. 16. The entire process is set at 60s, \nFig. 14.TEM images of the used PS/SiO 2 composite abrasives (a) and PS/CeO 2 \ncomposite abrasives (b) after CMP [43]. X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n12and the effectiveness of the process is explored by setting different times \nfor the two-step process. the optimal process time is ceria 40s/DIW 20s. \nUnder this process, the particle area ratio (the ratio of the area of cerium \nparticles to the total area) decreased from 9.035% to 0.839%. The Ce \nconcentration decreased from 1552.55 ppb to 83.25 ppb through ICP-MS testing. The surface roughness is 0.150 nm. Therefore, cleaning \nefficiency and surface quality have reached a higher level. \nLiu P et al. [54] prepared N2 water and CO2 water using a gas dis-\nsolved water system. The pH values of DIW, N2 and CO2 water are 6.2, \n5.2 and 3.9, respectively. The results showed that PRE of ceria obtained \nFig. 15.FE-SEM images (at 10kx magnifications) of SiO2 surfaces after CMP and post-CMP cleaning process.

X. Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n13by N2 water and CO2 water cleaning were both greater than that ob-\ntained by DIW, and the PRE obtained by CO2 water cleaning was the \nhighest. The residual cerium oxide particles on the wafer surface are \neasy to agglomerate after N2 water and DIW cleaning, but the residual \nparticles obtained after CO2 water cleaning are relatively dispersed. The \nexperiments were conducted by changing the concentration of CO2 in \nCO2 water, and it was found that PRE of ceria decreased with the \ndecrease of CO2 concentration. The surface roughness is 0.613 \n\u00b10.025 nm when the particle size is large, while the surface roughness \nis 0.077\u00b10.010 nm when the particle size is small. The PRE of ceria \nobtained through CO2 water cleaning is the highest and the surface \nroughness is the lowest, whether the cerium oxide particles with large or \nsmall size are cleaned. The CO2 water cleaning mechanism is (as shown \nin Fig. 17) mainly relies on CO2 (with negative Zeta potential) adsorp -\ntion on the surface of cerium oxide particles (with positive Zeta poten -\ntial) to prevent the aggregation and accumulation of cerium oxide \nparticles on the substrate surface. Lee J et al. [55] used tangential flow \nfiltration (TFF) system to filter out cerium oxide particles with smaller \nparticle size (D50nm) for dielectric CMP, and then cleaned them with \nDIW. This method increased the PRE of water cleaning by 18.1%, \nachieving performance similar to SC1 (NH 4OH:H 2O2:H2O\uff0c1:1:5) \nsolution. When using water cleaning, the PRE of ceria can be increased by \nimproving the process time or dissolving gas in water. Adding CO2 to \nwater provides a new way for removing small-sized cerium oxide \nnanoparticles. Although the TFF system improves the PRE of ceria for \nwater cleaning, it is only suitable for the using large-sized cerium oxide \nparticles for CMP. Water cleaning can achieve larger PRE of ceria \nwithout causing secondary pollution, which not only saves costs but also \nprotects the environment. In line with the concept of green and envi-\nronmental protection, water cleaning is a big trend in the future. \n4.3. Chemical cleaning \nChemical cleaning is generally combined with physical cleaning \nmethods. Chemical cleaning plays a major role in the post CMP cleaning \nprocess due to the special Ce-O-Si bond between cerium oxide and sili-\ncon dioxide. The most commonly assisted physical cleaning methods are \npolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) brushing [56,57] and ultrasonic cleaning [58]. \nSeo J et al. [50] studied the cleaning efficiency (CE) of SC1 cleaning \nsolution with different component proportions under ultrasonic on \ncerium oxide particles with size of 10, 30 and 90nm. It was found that \nwhen H2O2 (30wt%) accounted for 43% and NH4OH (30wt%) \naccounted for 57%, that is, the molar concentration was basically equal, \nthe CE of the three different particle size abrasives was relatively high, \nall of which were 99%, exceeding the CE of the standard SC1 solution \n(19%, 58%, 94%). This is because the molar concentrations of peroxide \nand hydroxide are essentially equal, and the concentration of HO2- in the \nsolution reaches its maximum value. HO2- removes cerium oxide parti-\ncles from the wafer surface by breaking the Si-O bond in Ce-O-Si. The \nremoval process is shown in Fig. 18. This method can effectively solve \nthe cleaning problem of small-sized cerium oxide nanoparticles. How-\never, the literature did not mention the analysis of the surface \nmorphology of the cleaned wafers. If the surface roughness is low, this \nmethod of high efficiency particle removal can be promoted. \nSahir S et al. [59] found that both megasonic cleaning and PVA brush \ncleaning could only achieve higher PRE for cerium oxide with larger \nparticle size, while chemical cleaning is more effective in removing ceria \nwith small particle size. When SC1 was used to clean wafers for less than \n10min, the PRE of ceria exceeded 95% for ceria nanoparticles with \nparticle sizes of 30,60 and 90nm. SC1 cleaning solution mainly gener -\nates relatively strong electrostatic repulsion by changing the surface \ncharge of particles and wafers, and has a slight etching effect to achieve \na better cleaning effect. Diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF) can be used to \nremove cerium oxide particles through lower shear mechanism and \netching. However, it has a good effect on ceria only with small particle \nsize. For cerium oxide particles with size of 30nm and 60nm, the PRE \ncan reach more than 95% by cleaning the wafer surface with DHF for \n60s. But for 90nm particles, PRE is below 80%. SPM (H2SO4:H2O2\uff0c \n2:1\u20134:1) is also more suitable for the removal of small-sized cerium \noxide particles, mainly because it can promote the dissolution of cerium \noxide. For 30nm cerium oxide, the PRE reaches 99%, but for 90nm \nparticles, the PRE is less than 20%. Therefore, in actual production, it is \nnecessary to determine the type of cleaning solution according to the \nparticle size of cerium oxide to be removed. However, due to the strong \nFig. 16.Schematic of the ceria remaining on the pad during chemical mechanical planarization [53].  \nFig. 17.The mechanism and comparison of DIW and CO2 water buff cleaning. \n(a) The ceria particles are electrostatically adsorbed on the oxide film, and the \ncontacted pad asperities dislodge the particles by sliding.

Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551\n14acidity of the reagent used, the surface morphology of the wafer may be \ngreatly affected. Song J et al.[60] developed a new cleaning solution \nconsisting of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), EDTA and \ndispersant. The silicon dioxide and silicon nitride films were respec -\ntively cleaned with the proposed cleaning solution. The particle cleaning \nefficiency (PCE) of silica surface reached 99.5%, among which ceria \ncleaning efficiency (CCE)reached 98.3%. The PCE and CCE of silicon \nnitride surface reached 97.8% and 96.3% respectively. Because the \ncleaning solution has no etching effect, the surface roughness obtained is \nbetter than that obtained by SC1 and SPM. However, the paper did not \nmention the particle size of cerium oxide. Since most cleaning methods \nhave a certain degree of selectivity for particle size, it is necessary to \ncompare the performance of cleaning solutions towards various particle \nsize. \nIn SC1, SPM and DHF chemical cleaning, a large amount of cleaning \nsolution is used, but they all cause certain etching on the wafer surface. \nTherefore, for future research directions, on the one hand, further \ndilution of the cleaning solution or the addition of mild additives should \nbe considered to reduce the etching effect and improve the surface \nquality; On the other hand, it is necessary to develop a new environ -\nmentally friendly cleaning solution to meet the removal of small parti-\ncles. The development trend of future cleaning solutions should also \nconsider green environmental protection and more use of harmless \norganic compounds for human health. In addition, room temperature \ncleaning processes are also a focus of research and development. The \ngreen cleaning solution with low cost and high CE for removing cerium \noxide is the future development direction. \n5.Conclusion \nWith the reduction of feature size in integrated circuits, the perfor -\nmance and surface residue requirements of dielectric layer CMP based \non cerium oxide abrasives have become increasingly stringent. This \narticle mainly summarizes the factors that affect the CMP performance \nof cerium oxide abrasives, including the particle size of cerium oxide \nabrasives, the value of Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087and surface modification. The particle \nsize can be controlled by changing the calcination temperature or \npreparation method. Generally speaking, particle size is proportional to \nMRR, but the optimal particle size needs to be determined based on the \nsurface quality of CMP chips. Ce3\u0087enhances chemical interactions dur-\ning wafer CMP process by forming Ce-O-Si bonds on the surface of silica, \nthereby improving MRR. The concentration of Ce3\u0087can be changed by \nmethods such as hydrogen reduction or introducing oxygen vacancies \nwith other additives. Physical and chemical modifications can alter the \ninherent chemical properties of cerium oxide without altering its surface morphology. This provides a reference for the changes in Ce3\u0087con-\ncentration and the improvement of selection rate. In addition, Ce par-\nticles will remain on the surface of the chip after dielectric CMP, which \nwill have a serious impact on the subsequent process of integrated cir-\ncuit manufacturing and even cause failure. Therefore, this article ana-\nlyzes the method of cleaning cerium oxide particles after CMP, which \nimproves the cleaning efficiency of cerium oxide by adding additives \nsuch as glycerol or complexing agents containing carboxyl functional \ngroups, or by dissolving gas in water. The use of acidic/alkaline chem -\nical reagents can effectively remove cerium oxide particles, but it is \nnecessary to consider how to achieve the best cleaning effect with the \nlowest concentration of reagents for different cerium oxide particle \nsizes. The improvement of MRR and the reduction of defects usually \ncannot be achieved simultaneously, so more systematic research is \nneeded to balance the relationship between the two. Furthermore, the \ndevelopment trend of cerium oxide abrasive CMP slurry and post \ncleaning is prospected, and it will be the optimal choice for cerium oxide \nabrasive CMP and post cleaning to be environmentally friendly and \nefficient. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nXinyu Han: Writing \u2013 review & editing, Writing \u2013 original draft. \nRenhao Liu: Writing \u2013 review & editing.

Its importance becomes highly underscored at the advanced \ndevice toward sub 14 nm scaling. The fundamental mechanism of CMP is to create soften \nsurface layer by chemical reaction and then, mechanical force by abrasive particles remove \nsoften layer. The role of CMP is not only material removal, but also planarization, surface \nsmoothening, uniformity control, defect reduction and more. Moreover, semiconductor \nyield enhancement is sensitively influenced by CMP processing. Surface scratching, which \nis generated by CMP in nature, is considered as \u2018killer defect\u2019 in semiconductor manufac -\nturing. Hence, to achieve proper CMP performance without surface scratching, under -\nstanding and development of abrasive particles are crucially important. In this chapter, \nCMP fundamentals, applications and challenges associated with abrasive particle technol -\nogy including synthesis (up to nanoparticle scale), tribochemical reaction, abrasive surface \nzeta potential behavior, particle size and its distribution will be discussed.\nKeywords:  semiconductor manufacturing, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), \nslurry, silica abrasive, ceria abrasive, alumina abrasive, advanced abrasive materials\n1. Introduction\nChemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has been used for several decades in semiconductor \nmanufacturing since its development at 1980s [ 1\u20135]. The original purpose of CMP is to pla -\nnarize wafer surface both locally and globally, which enable subsequent lithographic pattern -\ning with proper depth of focus [ 1\u20135]. However, as device shrinkage continues, it has become \ncritical process for device fabrication, and its applications play a pivotal role in semiconductor \nprocess since transistor scaling becomes beyond 14 nm [ 5\u20139]. The role of CMP and planarized \nwafer associated with lithography patterning is shown in Figure 1  schematically [ 1, 4].  \n\u00a9 2018 The Author(s). Licensee IntechOpen.

Furthermore, advantages of employment of CMP in semiconductor manufacturing \nare [ 4, 5]: (1) elimination of step coverage burden, (2) defect removal from prior process steps,  \n(3) surface smoothening in wafer scale, and (4) enablement of metal gate formation at sub \n14 nm device. The fundamental mechanism of CMP process is [ 1\u20134]: (1) Material surface \nbecomes soften by chemical reaction with slurry, (2) Mechanical force by abrasive particle \nin the slurry removes soften layer and step height reduction, (3) Material surface reacts with \nslurry chemical to make surface soften layer again and repeat (1) \u2013 (3). Therefore, chemistry \nand abrasive particles in the slurry determines CMP performances. This procedure is given \nin Figure 2 . With this process, fast material removal across the wafer with planarization can \nbe achieved. From the abrasive perspective, abrasive-wafer contact model on removal rate \nhas been published in many literatures which emphasize abrasive particle size (and size dis -\ntribution) and shape, and abrasive hardness. Although CMP application had started from \nplanarization of excessed dielectric materials, its utilization have been widely accepted in \nshallow trench isolation, contact and metal interconnection formation [ 1\u201310 ]. Recently, sub \n14 nm semiconductor scaling has developed device integration scheme to 3-dimensional tran -\nsistor formation such as fin field-effect transistor, therefore device process flow becomes much \nmore complicated than previous device node [ 6\u20139, 11, 12 ]. Hence, application of CMP extends \nto transistor formation, and importance of CMP process becomes highly underscored.\nFigure 3(a)  shows polisher equipment and wafer polishing processing. Polishing head holds \nwafers by vacuum and it rotates on the polishing pad. Slurry is delivered by slurry arm and \npolishing pad conditioner refreshes polishing pad surface as each wafer processing, which \nresults in global planarization and polishing. Whereas, in microscale observation, compli -\ncated interaction among pad asperity-slurry (abrasive and chemistry)-wafer surface occurs \nduring CMP processing, which is depicted in Figure 3 . According to semiconductor process \ndevelopment, CMP process itself has developed its equipment, consumables, polishing func -\ntions and slurries to improve performance.\nCMP performances are defined by removal rate (throughput), selectivity, planarization (pla -\nnarity), within wafer non-uniformity, surface topography (roughness), corrosion and post \nCMP defects. The definitions of them are:\nFigure 1.  The concept of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Non-planarized topography becomes planarized surface \nby CMP.Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 184\n  Removal Rate  (RR) \u2007=\u2007 (pre CMP thickness \u2013post CMP thickness ) \u200a/\u200a (polishing time )   \n  Within Wafer Uniformity \u2007=\u2007Film thickness sigma post CMP \u200a/\u200aFilm mean thickness post CMP   \n  Selectivity   (A\u200a:\u200aB) \u2007=\u2007RR of A material \u200a/\u200aRR of B material   \nPlanarization is commonly measured by step height reduction rate. These performances are \nclosely related with device yield and electrical performances. For example, CMP-induced \nmicroscratch defect ( Figure 4 ) is detrimental to device yield [ 3, 5]; transistor resistance is \nstrongly influenced by post CMP uniformity, and residual material blocks subsequent pat -\nterning. CMP performances are determined by multiple CMP process factors; however, CMP \nslurry is the most influencing parameter. CMP slurry consists of abrasive particles and chemi -\ncal components such as pH adjuster, dispersant, polymeric additives, oxidizer, and passivation \nagent, depending on polishing purpose to provide proper surface modification of material.\nAs described in Figure 3 , direct contact between abrasive particle and wafer surface removes \nmaterial, thus, properties and characteristics of abrasive particle and their understanding are \ninevitable to optimize CMP process. Although a lot of different kinds of abrasives have been \ntried for CMP applications, three abrasives have been employed successfully until recent device \nmanufacturing. They are silica-based abrasive, ceria-based abrasive, and alumina-based abra -\nsive. However, CMP is indispensable process for future semiconductor fabrication and it needs \ndevelopment of new abrasives for the success of new designed device and matured manufac -\nturing. Figure 5  shows CMP abrasive market trend in semiconductor industry [ 14]. Its growth \nexpectation for the next 4 years is about 30% increase from 2016. This chapter introduces abra -\nsive particles and their applications to CMP process for semiconductor manufacturing.\nFigure 2.  The schematic mechanism of material removal by CMP.\nFigure 3.  The schematic of conventional CMP equipment.Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408185\n2. Abrasive for dielectric CMP\nA dielectric material in semiconductor processing refers to insulating materials and mostly \nit indicates all kinds of silicon oxide materials [ 5]. Most dielectric CMP applications focus on \ntransistor formation, which is called as front end of the line (FEOL) process. And dielectric CMP \nrequires either oxide bulk CMP or CMP stop on \u2018stopper\u2019 material. For the stop on CMP case, \noxide material is removed by CMP and CMP stops when stopper material is exposed. Shallow \ntrench isolation (STI) CMP and interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP are representative dielectric \nCMP applications. STI CMP process (stop on \u2018silicon nitride\u2019) is described in Figure 6  [3]  \nas an example of dielectric CMP. The stopper materials are mostly silicon nitride or poly-\nsilicon in FEOL process. For dielectric CMP purpose, two \u2013 three major abrasives are used in \nthe advanced node semiconductor manufacturing.\n2.1. Silica-based slurry and silica abrasive\nAs briefly described in the introduction, CMP mechanism is soft layer removal by abrasive \nparticle. This section introduces silica particle as slurry abrasive. During dielectric CMP pro -\ncess, silicon oxide surface reacts with OH\u2212 from the slurry solution and forms silicon hydrox -\nide, Si(OH)4. The hydration reaction is.\nFigure 4.  The examples of CMP-induced microscratch images [13].\nFigure 5.  Slurry abrasive market trend (Reprinted from Ref. [ 14] with permission from author. Copyright Linx-\nconsulting). FS is fumed silica, UHPCS is ultra-high purity colloidal silica and CSI is colloidal silica abrasive.Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 186\n    ( SiO  2  )   \nx   +  2H  2  \u2009O \uf0e0\u2009  ( SiO  2  )   \nx\u22121   + Si\u2009  (OH)   4    \nAnd this soften Si(OH)4 is mechanically removed by silica abrasive [ 3, 15]. Then silicon oxide \nsurface is exposed and hydration occurs again. This process is repeating until silicon oxide \ndisappears. From Figure 2 , soft layer can be considered as Si(OH)4 in this case. The hydration \nrate is influenced by the concentration of OH\u2212 ions in the solution, thus alkaline environment \ncan accelerate surface hydration and make fast material removal by fast reaction [ 2, 15\u201316]. \nTherefore high pH silica-abrasive slurry is favorable to obtain high removal rate. Two common \nsynthesizing methods of silica abrasives are commercially used in the semiconductor industry. \nOne is fumed process and the other is colloidal process [ 5, 17\u201319]. The typical abrasive images \nFigure 6.  Procedure of shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP. Polishing stop on silicon nitride (Reprinted with permission \nfrom Ref. [3 ]. Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society).Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408187\nof silica abrasive by each synthesis methods are shown in Figure 7  [20, 21 ]. Fumed silica syn -\nthesis uses flame reaction of chlorosilane at high temperature, which is summarized at.\n   SiCl  4   +  2H  2   +  O  2  \u2009 \uf0e0\u2009 SiO  2   + 4HCl   \nWith this method, early development of silica abrasive particle size is larger than 300 \u00c5, but \ndevelopment of filtration and post treatment enables to control the abrasive size below 150 \u00c5. \nThe commercial fumed silica abrasive slurry for dielectric CMP has high abrasive concentra -\ntion to achieve enough removal rate. However, high abrasive concentration caused scratch \ndefects, easy to agglomerate and clogging problem in slurry delivery system or filter.\nFigure 8  shows example of clogged silica abrasive, which leads to significant defects on the \nwafer at post CMP. The whitish particles are silica abrasive in the slurry loop system. Therefore \nrecent device manufacturing use high percentage of fumed silica abrasive slurry less and less, \nand forecast expects less usage of fumed silica abrasive as shown in Figure 5 . Contrary to \nfumed method, colloidal abrasive is synthesized by liquid phase growth process via precursor \n[5, 16, 18 \u201325]. Commonly, colloidal silica is made from sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) or sodium \nmeta-silicate (NaHSiO3). By ion exchange, sodium ion is eliminated and colloidal silica is \nformed to be used as CMP slurry abrasive. Colloidal silica abrasive slurry has much lower \nremoval rate than fumed silica abrasive although it gives much lower scratch defect perfor -\nmance by its spherical shape and small size. To enhance removal rate of dielectric material by \ncolloidal silica, organic cation is added as removal booster [ 16]. It changes colloidal silica abra -\nsive surface charge from negative into positive and coulombic attraction force between abra -\nsive and dielectric surface, which is negative, accelerates removal rate. As shown in Figure 9(a) , \nsurface zeta potential behavior with respect to pH [ 26] can support this mechanism. Schematic \nof enhanced removal rate by colloidal silica abrasive is given in the same Figure. pH control \nis critical to this case. Recently, several attempts to new synthesis of silica abrasive to add \nFigure 7.  TEM images of (a) fumed (Reprinted by permission from [ 20], Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society) and \n(b) colloidal silica abrasive [21].Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 188\nFigure 8.  The clogged silica abrasive in slurry delivery loop.\nFigure 9.  (a) Zeta potential of SiO2, and (b) silica abrasive without surface treatment and with surface treatment with \norganic cation at acidic region.Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408189\nmore stable particle distribution have been reported [ 26\u201329]. For instance, Pan et al. presented \nsilane modified silica abrasive particle preparation to mitigate gelation of colloidal silica due \nto high chemically active hydroxyl group from silica surface. The siloxane groups in silane and \nhydroxyl groups in silica surface generate hydrolysis condensation reaction, which results in \nsurface zetapotential change to improve dispersion stability [ 27].\n2.2. Ceria abrasive for dielectric CMP slurry\nAlthough high removal rate, low cost of ownership and effective planarization are obtained \nby silica abrasive, selectivity control and low scratch defect requirements bring ceria-based \nabrasive to be universally used in dielectric CMP of advanced node semiconductor manu -\nfacturing. And recent dielectric CMP uses ceria-based slurry much more than before (refers \nto Figure 5 ). The CMP mechanism by ceria-based slurry is different from silica-based slurry. \nInstead of mechanical removal by silica abrasive, ceria abrasive uses surface interaction with \nsilicon oxide dominantly, which is.\n  \u2212\u200aCe \u2212 OH + \u2212\u200a SiO   \u2212 \u2009\uf0e0 \u2212 Si \u2212 O \u2212 Ce +  OH   \u2212   \nStrong bonding between Ce and hydrated silicate detach silicon oxide and Si-O-Ce lump is \nremoved from the surface [15, 30]. Ceria CMP process is shown in Figure 10 .\nTherefore, ceria abrasive surface charge control is important in determining CMP perfor -\nmance. The surface charge behavior can be indicated by ceria zeta potential property [ 31]. \nAs shown in Figure 11(a) , isoelectric point (IEP) of ceria is ~pH 8 (at acidic: positive charge, \nat alkaline: negative charge) and surface potential is opposite to silicon oxide at acidic envi -\nronment. Thus, most ceria-abrasive slurry pH is less than 8 to facilitate Si-O-Ce formation. \nSimilar to silica abrasive synthesis, two types of ceria-base abrasive are commonly synthe -\nsized for CMP applications [ 5, 31, 32 ]. They are calcined ceria abrasive and wet (or colloidal) \nceria abrasive. Calcined synthesis is based on solid-state oxidation process. Raw ceria mate -\nrial is oxidized followed by mechanical crushing to make them small particles. And filtra -\ntion removes large particles. Depending on crushing condition and filtration, calcined ceria \nabrasive size can be controlled. On the other hand, wet process uses precipitation procedure \nin liquid state. Seed ceria nuclei in an aqueous cerium solution grows and forms ceria (or \ncerium hydroxide) particles. Ceria abrasive made by wet process has spherical shape and nar -\nrow particle size distribution compared with calcined process. These synthesis methods and \ntypical ceria abrasive images from each method are shown in Figure 11(b) \u2013(d) schematically \nFigure 10.  The schematic mechanism of oxide removal rate by ceria abrasive.Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 190\n[31, 33 \u201335]. The overall property comparison between calcined processed ceria abrasive and \ncolloidal ceria abrasive is summarized in Table 1  [31]. Calcined ceria abrasive slurry pro -\nvides steady removal rate. Wet ceria abrasive slurry shows relatively lower removal rate than \ncalcined ceria abrasive, however, the most critical advantage of wet ceria abrasive slurry is \nscratch defect improvement due to small and regular shape of abrasive particle. Recent study \nby Seo revealed Ce surface oxidation state had significant influence on the CeO2 interaction to \nsilicate and they investigated the effect of concentration of Ce3+ ions on the affinity to silicate \nions and wet ceria particle size effect on the adsorption of silicate [ 35, 36 ]. Higher concentra -\ntion of Ce3+ ions increased adsorption affinity with silicate ions and larger ceria abrasive has \nFigure 11.

[34] with permission from authors)).Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408191\nhigher Ce3+ ions due to higher surface to volume ratio. In addition to calcined and wet process, \nflux method to synthesize ceria abrasive particle has proposed to overcome limitation of cal -\ncined or wet process [ 37]. It uses cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O) and potassium \nhydroxide (KOH) as starting material and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2)-DI mixture as solvent. \nThrough precipitation, hydrothermal reaction and centrifuging process, narrow size distribu -\ntion with desirable characteristics ceria abrasives synthesis are demonstrated [ 37]. Ceria or \nceria-based slurry application in CMP is increasing and advanced slurries with ceria abrasive \nare emerging in the semiconductor industry. Ultrafine (or nano-sized) ceria abrasive and com -\nposite abrasive will be introduced in Section 5.\n3. Abrasive for tungsten CMP\nTungsten has been used for metal interconnection and contact formation. Many candidate \nmetals have been developed to replace tungsten; however, tungsten is still standard metal \nfor sub 14 nm contact formation due to its excellent electromigration and diffusion barrier \nperformance [ 3, 38 ]. The CMP mechanism of tungsten was proposed by Kaufmann firstly [ 39]. \nA pristine tungsten surface is oxidized by oxidizer at acidic condition and it transforms to \ntungsten oxide (WOx). The formation of oxide depends on solution and chemistry. Tungsten \noxide plays a role as passivation layer to protect subsurface tungsten from dissolution or cor -\nrosion. And tungsten oxide is easy to be removed by mechanical force of abrasive since its \nhardness is less than pure tungsten. This process is repeated until CMP stops. Therefore, role \nof chemistry (in particular oxidizer) is important in tungsten CMP. Among many kinds of \noxidizer, ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3-) is the most successful one [ 3, 5]. The schematic description \nof tungsten CMP mechanism is given in Figure 12 . The common and commercially avail -\nable slurry for tungsten CMP has alumina-base and silica-base abrasives [ 3, 5]. At sub 14 nm \nlogic device fabrication, tungsten CMP is the most important process to enable transistor \nformation. It requires superior planarity and extremely accurate uniformity control. For this \npurpose, alumina abrasive showed better planarity and selectivity performance. Hence its \nutilization for bulk tungsten CMP is commonly adopted in advanced device manufacturing.

Properties of calcined CeO2 and colloidal CeO2 (Reprinted from Ref. [31] with permission from author).Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 192\nAlumina abrasive has been synthesized by alum process and calcination [ 18]. For CMP appli -\ncation, alpha-alumina abrasive is commonly used. Hardness of alumina abrasive is much \nhigher than tungsten and tungsten oxide, therefore it is easy to make scratch defect on the sur -\nface. Moreover, due to the surface charge difference between alumina and tungsten at acidic \nregion, attractive force retains alumina abrasive on the wafer surface. Recently, composite \nalumina abrasive with polymeric material has been introduced in the industry due to defect \nconcern at advanced node semiconductor [ 38]. Silica base slurry utilization on tungsten CMP \nis usually for non-selective CMP purpose (polishing both tungsten and dielectric material) \nbecause its selectivity with oxide is not as high as alumina abrasive slurry. Tungsten CMP \nis driven by chemical effect more than mechanical abrasion, removal rate strongly depends \non chemical components (oxidizer, surfactant, and stabilizer) and activation condition (for \nexample, process temperature) [ 39\u201341 ]. Therefore adequate combinations among them are \nessential to provide desired CMP performances. Although removal rate is linearly increasing \nwith abrasive concentration in the slurry, loading effect (very low removal rate or non-linear \nremoval rate behavior at the early stage of CMP) is more significant in tungsten CMP than \ndielectric CMP. Yttrium, ceria, zirconium and composite abrasives have been tried and under \ndevelopment for tungsten CMP applications [3].\n4. Abrasive for copper CMP\nCopper is introduced in semiconductor manufacturing for metal interconnection application \nmid-1990s and now it is standard metal for back end of the line interconnection [ 2\u20134, 10]. \nAccordingly, CMP for copper has been highlighted due to its process challenges. Like tung -\nsten CMP, copper CMP mechanism is based on Kaufman\u2019s model. Chemical reaction from \nslurry produces oxidized copper and abrasive particle removes oxidized copper. The major \ncomponents of copper CMP slurry are abrasive, oxidizer, inhibitor, surfactant and chelating \nagent. The challenges of copper CMP are scratch defects and copper corrosion. Corrosion is \nFigure 12.  The mechanism of tungsten CMP.Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408193\nFigure 13.  Synthesis of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive (reprinted from Ref. [ 33] with permission from authors).mostly induced by chemical in the slurry and most of scratch defects are driven by abrasive \nparticle. In particular, hardness of copper is lower than most abrasive particles. Therefore, \nsmaller size of abrasive with spherical shape and less abrasive content are favorable to the \nslurry formulation. The common copper CMP abrasives are alumina and colloidal silica [ 3, \n10]. However, at advanced semiconductor manufacturing, colloidal silica abrasive becomes \nprevalent because it has appreciable polish rate of barrier material (tantalum/tantalum \nnitride). The copper removal rate and CMP performances are sensitively influenced by chem -\nistries and components in slurry in conjunction with silica abrasive characteristics. Most of \ncopper CMP slurry researches have focused on chemistry perspective instead of abrasives.\n5. Advanced abrasives for future CMP applications\nOne of the most important requirements of CMP process in semiconductor application is \nscratch defect reduction, which has mentioned in this chapter several times. For abrasive per -\nspective, smaller size abrasive particle is favorable for scratch defect. Therefore, recent abrasive \ntechnology has focused on nano-sized abrasive synthesis with minimized agglomeration. For \ndielectric CMP, nano-sized cerium hydroxide (or ultrafine cerium hydroxide or nano-ceria) \nabrasive slurry has been introduced due to its potential scratch defect reduction [ 33\u201334, 42 \u201343]. \nThe synthesis procedure of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive is given in Figure 13 .\nTransmission electron microscope image of calcined ceria abrasive and nano-sized abrasive \nis compared in Figure 14  [44]. Single abrasive size becomes as small as 5 nm. Even agglomer -\nated abrasive size is less than 20 nm. Tanaka et al., showed removal rate and selectivity control \nby changing additives [ 33\u201334 ]. However, CMP mechanism of nano-sized cerium hydroxide \nabrasive is not clearly understood yet. Han et al. reported polishing pad surface roughness \ncontrol is critical to maintain removal rate stability with nano-sized cerium hydroxide abra -\nsive [ 44]. Kim proposed particle coverage model on the wafer as material removal mechanism \nwith nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive [ 43]. In order to apply nano-sized cerium hydrox -\nide abrasive for dielectric CMP, role of chemistry to enhance removal rate with selectivity \ncontrol needs to be further explored.\nComposite abrasive has drawn attention to the semiconductor industry recently. Each abra -\nsive has its own unique properties. Some of them are very attractive and some of them are \nnot good for desired CMP performances. Tries to combine advantages only from different \nabrasives have triggered ceria-silica composite abrasive development [ 45\u201348 ]. Researchers \nhave paid attention to ceria-coated silica as next generation CMP slurry abrasive. Zhao et al. Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 194\nuses sol\u2013gel method to synthesize ceria-coated silica abrasive [ 48]. They prepared tetraethy -\nlorthosilicate and ammonia as raw materials, and composite nanoparticles are synthesized \nthrough precipitation procedure. About 150\u2013200 nm spherical ceria-coated silica abrasives are \nsuccessfully synthesized. Shell ceria size is 10 nm. Peedikakkandy et al. synthesized mono-\ndispersed ceria coated silica nanoparticles by micro-emulsion method and chemical precipita -\ntion process [ 46]. About~10 nm crystalline ceria over silica with spherical shape and overall \nparticle size <100 nm abrasive is successfully obtained. Zhang et al. synthesized ceria-coated \nsilica abrasive by precipitation process using ammonium cerium nitrate and urea as precipi -\ntant with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) as assistant [ 45]. With optimized synthesis conditions, \n<200 nm ceria-coated silica abrasive is obtained. In their study, X-ray diffraction confirms \nface centered cubic CeO2 nanoparticle encapsulate core silica. Scanning electron microscope \n(SEM) shows uniformly distributed particles with spherical shape. Transmission electron \nmicroscope (TEM) directly shows evidence of homogenous nucleation of ceria particles and \nheterogeneous nucleation of silica particle with uniform, distinctive and crystalline ceria \nshell. With ceria-coated silica composite abrasive, higher removal rate than pure silica abra -\nsive and comparable surface roughness is demonstrated on glass substrate CMP. Likewise \nceria-coated ceria abrasive, Chen et al. reported composite abrasive containing solid silica \ncore with silica mesoporous shell structure [ 29]. The advantage of mesoporous silica is its \nsignificant elastic recovery ability combined with ductile behavior. Chen et al. synthesized \nsolid silica core via conventional St\u00f6ber procedure and shell silica encapsulating the core by \nmeans of modified St\u00f6ber process. It uses vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) as silica source and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide as structure directing agent. Well defined spherical shape \nabrasives are successfully achieved and it shows clearly core-shell structure. The thickness of \nmesoporous silica shell is controlled by VTMS amount during synthesis. With this abrasive, \nhigher removal rate of thermal silicon dioxide film and lower surface roughness are exhibited. \nPolymeric composite has drawn attention to CMP society due to its potential scratch defect \nreduction. Chen et al. reported polymer based core-shell abrasive aiming to reduce scratch \nFigure 14.  TEM images of (a) calcined ceria abrasive and (2) nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive (reprinted by \npermission from Ref. [44 ], Copyright 2013 Springer Nature).Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408195\ndefect by CMP. The core abrasive is spherical polystyrene (PS) and ceria is selected as shell \nabrasive [ 49]. The mechanism of low scratch and minimize wafer damage is cushion effect of \nsoft polymer core abrasive. In-situ chemical precipitation with mixture of deionized water, PS \nspheres, cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O), and hexamethyleneteramine is used \nfor this hybrid abrasive synthesis. As shown in Figure 15 , it is clearly observed uniformly dis -\ntributed ceria particles on the PS core, indicating the formation of core/shell structured abra -\nsive particle. The ceria particle size is about 10 nm and face centered cubic structure which is \nconfirmed by XRD and SAED pattern. Based on CMP test with thermal oxide film, PS/ceria \nhybrid abrasive slurry demonstrates lower removal rate, fewer scratches, and lower surface \nroughness are compared with ceria abrasive slurry.\nNano-sized ceria abrasive is already used in the semiconductor manufacturing. Ceria-silica \nor silica-silica composite abrasive is still under development stage although several unique \nsynthesizes are suggested and demonstrate promising CMP data. Most of literatures with \ncomposite abrasive focus on material removal rate and surface quality. However, CMP appli -\ncation needs more performances. In order to be utilized in the industry, composite abrasives \nhave to avoid agglomeration, need to robust abrasive stability, require optimized chemistry, \nand more CMP performances such as selectivity and defectivity must be fulfilled.\nNew materials CMP has emerged along with new device introduction and device node \nshrinkage, from ultra-soft materials such as porous low-k and photoresist to highly non-\nreactive metal such as ruthenium (Ru) [ 3\u20135, 50, 51 ]. Ultra-soft material CMP needs very soft \nabrasive or even abrasive-free slurry development [ 5]. Ru is little chemical reactive metal \nwith high hardness. And it relies more on mechanical force to remove Ru layer than chemical \ndissolution. Moreover, RuO4, which can be produced by slurry chemistry, is toxical gas [ 50, \n51]. Therefore Ru CMP has a lot of limitation to achieve enough removal rate by CMP. Cobalt \n(Co) is the most potential candidate metal for replacing tungsten as contact metal (or replac -\ning Ta/TaN as barrier metal) and its CMP slurry abrasive development is upmost challenge \nfor device fabrication [ 52\u201354 ]. Known issues by Co CMP are residual abrasive particle defects \nand Co corrosion. More difficulties on these materials are not only target material CMP but \nFigure 15.  (a) SEM images and (b) TEM images of PS/ceria composite abrasive (Reprinted by permission from Ref. [ 49], \nCopyright 2016 Springer Nature).Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 196\nalso neighboring materials CMP for proper selectivity. Most of new materials CMP slurry is \nbased on silica abrasive and chemistry optimization has been underscored. However, it still \nhas a lot of opportunities to develop abrasives as well. Carbon based materials (either carbon \nnanotube or graphene) have drawn intense interests to the semiconductor industry for a long \ntime. For CMP perspective, carbon-based material polishing, which has been rarely reported, \nis big challenge to abrasive development due to its high hardness.\n6. Abrasive control in semiconductor fab\nThe role of abrasive in CMP application is to obtain enough material removal rate, desired \nselectivity and low defect (residual particle and scratch) performance. In addition to develop \nadvanced abrasive material and synthesis, abrasive size distribution and dispersive ability in \nthe solution has been developed to control large particle count. Particle size distribution is \nraw abrasive material nature resulting from synthesis, however, slurry distribution system \nand filtration can control large particles and agglomeration from the slurry without CMP per -\nformance degradation. In high volume semiconductor manufacturing fab, slurry distribution \nsystem is considered as infrastructure instead of equipment [ 18, 55 ]. It consists of (1) slurry \ndrum, (2) agitation of drum (drum tumbling), (3) slurry blending and dispense, (4) daytank \n(or standby tank) with stirrer, (5) looping to tools. Figure 16  shows simplified distribution \nsystem. Slurry is being circulated in the loop until it is used for CMP. Abrasive agglomeration \nis induced by shear stress, temperature change and chemistry variation if proper filtration is \nnot implemented [ 56]. The location of filters from slurry distribution system is selected care -\nfully. More filtration drops slurry flow pressure quickly by filter itself. Very fine filter will \nremoves most abrasives, which results in low removal rate. Different slurry needs different \ntype of filter and filtration at different locations; however global loop filtration and point of \nuse (POU) filtration at polishing equipment are quite standard [ 18, 56, 57 ]. Global filter size \nis normally >10 \u03bcm, which is bigger than POU filter to avoid flow pressure drop. POU filter \nsize is smaller than 1 \u03bcm. Yi Wei et al., showed agglomeration behavior of different slurries. \nFigure 16.  Slurry delivery facilities in semiconductor manufacturing fab. (SD = slurry dispense, SBD = standby \ndistribution).Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408197\nColloidal silica abrasive agglomeration is more sensitive to shear stress than ceria abrasive. \nThe most important challenge of filtration is plugging by abrasives. Three plugging mecha -\nnisms in filtration are well known, which are cake formation, gradual plugging, and complete \nplugging [ 58]. Cake formation is driven by particles build up on the filter surface, gradual \nplugging is induced by particles building up on the pore, and compete plugging indicates pore \nblocking by particles. Depending on particle size, deformability, and agglomeration, filtration \nprocedure can be optimized. The most commonly used filter in CMP slurry is \u2018graded density \ndepth\u2019 type. It has multi-layers of fibrous media and there is retention gradient along with flow \ndirection. Commonly, large particles are captured first at outer layer and small particles are \nretained at inner layer. However, more advanced filter and filtration researches are reported \nrecently. Nano-fiber based advanced filter to remove large abrasive as well as avoid agglom -\neration is reported. Morby et al., suggested composite/rigid structured filter which consists of \nthermally bonded polyolefin bi-component coarse fiber matrix and microfiber-glass web as \nnext generation filter to retain slurry flow pressure and remove large abrasive effectively [ 59]. \nIn addition to filtration, dispersant in the slurry prevents abrasive from agglomeration. For \nhigh abrasive content slurry case, abrasive particles are easy to sediment and agglomerate by \nparticle charge interaction. Along with slurry abrasive development, advanced filter develop -\nment and prevention of sediment of abrasive are required in slurry preparation.\n7. Conclusion\nThis chapter reviews abrasives for CMP applications in semiconductor manufacturing. It \nincludes abrasive types, abrasive synthesis, CMP mechanism and role of abrasives, and oppor -\ntunities of new abrasive developments. Semiconductor business increases explosively and \nvarious semiconductor structures with high performance have been developed according to \nmarket requirement. In order to achieve mature semiconductor manufacturing, CMP process \ndevelopment is critical and abrasives in slurry play a pivotal role in determining CMP perfor -\nmances. The most common abrasive in dielectric CMP is either silica-based or ceria-based one. \nFor metal CMP (tungsten and copper), silica is the most popular abrasive. Advanced synthesis \nfor silica or ceria abrasives, new abrasive materials, and composite abrasives have studied for \nhigh performance CMP and new material CMP. Furthermore, the control of slurry abrasive \nin the looping is emphasized. Advanced filtration is critical to maintain abrasive size distribu -\ntion. The applications of CMP are mostly focused on semiconductor industry; however its \nutilization expands to display industry, M/NEMs, automobile industry and biotechnology. \nThe key of each application is noble abrasive development with proper chemistries.\nAuthor details\nHong Jin Kim\nAddress all correspondence to: hongjin.kim@globalfoundries.com\nAdvanced Module Engineering, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Malta, NY, USAAbrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 198\nReferences\n[1] Li Y, edited.

Finally, the\nchallenges and future research directions related to the chemical and mechanical process and slurry chemistry are\nhighlighted.\nDr. Jihoon Seo is a research assistant professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Clarkson\nUniversity, USA. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in materials science and engineering from\nHanyang University (HYU), Seoul, Korea in 2010, and his Ph.D. degree in energy engineering from HYU\nin 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Ungyu Paik. He was a post-doctoral research associate at the Center\nfor Advanced Materials Processing at Clarkson University from October 2017 to February 2018, where he\nwas mentored by Prof. S.V. Babu. Dr. Seo has worked on many research projects in various fields ranging\nfrom fundamental principles (e.g., surface chemistry, colloidal chemistry, nanotechnology, and electrochem-\nistry) to practical applications [e.g., Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and post-CMP cleaning]. In\nparticular, throughout his career, his research interests have focused on the development of CMP slurries\nand post-CMP cleaning solutions through a fundamental understanding of colloid and surface chemistry, liq-\nuid\u2013solid interface chemistry, and the electrochemistry of various metallic and dielectric thin films and het-\nerogeneous structures containing them. The main objective of his research is not only to understand the\nvarious phenomena occurring at the wafer interface during polishing and cleaning but also to provide\nresearchers who study CMP and post-CMP cleaning processes with new strategies and novel concepts for\nthe development of advanced processes for future devices.\nIntroduction\nChemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is one of the most\ncritical processes to achieve multilevel metallization and incor-\nporation of gate and channel materials during integrated circuit\n(IC) fabrication [1, 2]. Applications of CMP can be found in\nthree main areas of IC manufacturing that include forming\nthe transistors (front-end-of-line, FEOL), the local electricalconnections between transistors (middle-of-line, MOL), and\nthe interconnect structures (back-end-of-line, BEOL) [1, 2].\nThe FEOL process contains all the necessary steps to build\nthe device architecture with a variety of CMP steps for different\nlayer combinations of SiO 2,S i3N4, and poly-Si stop layers, SiC,\nSiCN, etc. and the high-k/metal gate structures [3, 4].

W and Co have attracted significant attention as an\nelectrically conducting material for local interconnects for the\nMOL process steps [5]. In the BEOL process steps, all the num-\nber of devices are interconnected by sequentially constructing\nmultilevel Cu wires and insulating layers [6]. CMP has been\nan enabling technology in the FEOL, the MOL, and the\nBEOL processes by achieving the desired removal rates, selec-\ntivity, and ultimately planarity with different substrate materi-\nals. Each CMP process requires different removal rates,\nselectivities, and process conditions. As feature sizes continue\nto decrease, requiring the fabrication of more complex geome-\ntries, tunable and selective polishing of different films has\nbecome even more critical. New CMP steps, including new\nmaterials and complex structures, are proposed and present\neven more stringent requirements.\nThe CMP process has become increasingly sophisticated\nover the years. Many of the underlying fundamental mecha-\nnisms are still not well understood. Indeed, CMP technology\nis advancing faster than our understanding of it. The evolution\nof high-volume-production CMP processes has its market-\ndriven schedules that are ahead of our understanding of the\nfundamental principles/technologies. Thus, the demand for\nunderstanding of various phenomena that occur during CMP\nis increasing in both industrial and academic research.\nCMP utilizes a synergistic interplay of chemical and\nmechanical interactions to achieve the desired removal rates,\nselectivity, and ultimately planarity with different substrate\nmaterials. During this process, the substrate is pressed down\ntypically onto a grooved polymeric, most commonlypolyurethane pad with controlled hardness and texture under\nan applied force (Fig. 1). The polishing slurry is transported\ninto the grooves, pores, and texture of the polyurethane pad\nby rotating the pad at high speed, which generates the chemical\nand mechanical actions involving three-body (slurry/polishing\npad/wafer) interactions (Fig. 1). Many factors including CMP\nconsumables and their process/tool conditions can impact\nthe polishing performance. In this review, I have focused\nmainly on CMP slurries and their relation to chemical and\nmechanical aspects of the CMP process. In general, the slurries\nfor the dielectric CMP process are composed of abrasives, dis-\npersant, passivation agent for high selectivity, pH adjuster, and\ndeionized water. In contrast with dielectric materials, metal\nCMP is governed by the electrochemical behavior of metal\nfilms in the presence of oxidizer, complexing agents, and cor-\nrosion inhibitors. Metal CMP slurries may contain additional\nchemical reagents like oxidizer, complexing agent, and corro-\nsion inhibitor. Typical slurry components for dielectric and\nmetal CMP processes are summarized in Table 1. Slurry for-\nmulations not only are different depending on the materials\nto be polished but also need to be optimized to meet the strin-\ngent process requirements [7, 8].

Also, the final section provides an\noverview of recently developed real-time in situ techniques to\nstudy some of the phenomena that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013\nwafer interface during polishing.\nModels Based on Contact Mechanics\nMaterial removal occurs when there is direct contact between\nan abrasive particle and wafer surface during polishing.\nModels based on contact mechanics were proposed to explain\nthe mechanical aspects of the material removal mechanism.\nAssuming that all particles are involved in material removal,\ntheir contact area on the particle \u2013wafer surface is given as\nA\u221dC1/3\u22c5d\u22121/3where Cis the concentration of the abrasive\nparticles and dis the abrasive diameter [9]. However, only\nabrasive particles larger than the gap between the polishing\npad and the wafer surface, termed as \u201cactive \u201dparticles, can con-\ntribute to material removal (Fig. 1) [10]. Of course, a larger gap\nwill result in less interaction between particles and wafer. Luo\nand Dornfeld assumed that only the plastic, but not elastic,\ndeformation caused by the indentation of the active particles\ninto the wafer surface results in material removal. They devel-\noped a mathematical model to predict the material removal\nrates considering the characteristics of the active abrasive par-\nticles (size, size distribution, and concentration), pad hardness,\nand CMP process conditions [10, 11]. The real contact area\n(Ar) at the wafer \u2013particle interface considering pad asperities\nwith a Greenwood \u2013Williamson approach was proposed by\nLee et al. [12], which can be expressed as Ar=(fs/C)\n(Rp/\u03c3p)1/2(PAw/Epw) where Rpis the average radius of curva-\nture of pad asperity, \u03c3pis the standard deviation of the pad\nasperity height, Pis the applied pressure, Awis the nominal\narea of the wafer surface, Epwis the compose Young \u2019s modulusof the pad and the wafer, fsis the area density of up area of the\ngrooved pad, and Cis a constant in the range of 0.3 \u20130.4. Lee\net al. reported that the real contact area ratio (real contact area/-\nnominal contact area) continued to decrease over the CMP\nprocess, leading to the deterioration in the material removal\nrates [13]. Park and Jeong suggested that a uniform roughness\npad provided much higher removal rates due to the larger real\ncontact area compared with a random roughness pad [14].\nWhile it is very difficult to observe the in situ movements of\nactive particles during polishing, the contact area of pad \u2013\nwafer can be measured and has been considered as the real con-\ntact area in most cases.\nBorucki has developed a tool to measure the real contact\narea of pad \u2013wafer using the confocal microscopy and analyzed\nthe contact image with digital image processing [15].\nPhilipossian et al. investigated the real contact area of a pad\nwith a wafer as a function of the process/tool conditions, pad\nconditioner, polishing pad, and their combinations [16, 17].\nThey observed that a higher contact area of pad \u2013wafer results\nin a higher material removal rate. Later, Lee measured the\nreal contact area of the polishing pad using a home-built tool\nas a function of applied pressure and abrasive size and pro-\nposed a modified semi-empirical model to predict the removal\nrates of SiO 2films [18].\nHowever, according to the classical contact mechanics, when\nthe real contact area between pad and wafer increases, the real\ncontact pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in the material\nremoval rate. The opposite conclusion may be drawn from the\nproperties of CMP consumables (slurry, films, polishing pad,\nconditioner, etc.), their characteristics, and CMP process condi-\ntions. More elaborate studies are needed to understand two\nopposing tendencies of material removal rates.\nThe classic equation for contact mechanics is Preston \u2019s\nequation [19] expressed as MRR = KPV where MRR is the\nmaterial removal rate, Kis Preston \u2019s coefficient, Pis the applied\npressure on the wafer surface, and Vis the relative velocity\nbetween the wafer and the polishing pad. Preston \u2019s equation\nwas very useful in explaining most of the removal rates of\ndielectric materials in the early stages of CMP technology.\nHowever, it assumes a linear relationship between pressure P\nand relative velocity Vand hence, is unable to explain non-\nlinear polishing behavior in actual CMP [20, 21]. Also,\nPreston \u2019s equation does not consider the properties of CMP\nconsumables and their characteristics. As the CMP process\nbecomes more and more complex, it has been difficult to pre-\ndict CMP results and explain their mechanism by only\nPreston \u2019s equation. Today \u2019s contact mechanics for the CMP\nprocess not only consider the properties of CMP consumables\nand their characteristics but also simulate the fluid dynamics\nand process parameters, which provide more reliable informa-\ntion on the actual CMP mechanism [20].TABLE 1.

Most previous models considered particle\nsize and size distribution, where the particle shape was assumed\nto be spherical. Their type, hardness, shape, particle agglomer-\nation, and chemical reactions between slurry and wafer surface\nhave a significant influence on the material removal rates.\nThese factors have to be taken into consideration in the math-\nematical model based solely on contact mechanics.\nLubrication Models\nDuring polishing, CMP slurries are transported to grooved\ntrenches, pores, and texture of a pad and improve hydrody-\nnamic lubrication (Fig. 1). Sundararajan et al. proposed a lubri-\ncation model for slurry flow and a mass transport model for\nmaterial removal by solving the Reynolds equation [22].\nAccording to their numerical results, a 40 \u201360\u03bcm slurry film\nbetween the wafer and the pad is expected at an applied pres-\nsure of 14 kPa and a linear velocity of 1.3 m/s. Slurry film\nthickness decreased to the range of 15 \u201330\u03bcm with higher\napplied pressure on the wafer. Lu et al. developed a dual emis-\nsion ultraviolet (UV)-enhanced fluorescence technique using a\ndual-camera imaging system to measure the thickness of the\nslurry film between the pad and a BK-7 wafer and in situ mon-\nitored the average slurry film thickness during polishing [23].\nPhilipossian \u2019s group modified this tool with high spatial\nresolution images, high-intensity UV laser pulses, and\nenhanced fluorescence [Fig. 2(a)] [24]. They used two different\nfluorescent dyes that can be excited at different wavelengths\nand recorded the fluorescence intensities of the dye molecules\nin the slurry using two high-resolution cameras. The intensity\nratio of light detected by each camera was converted to slurry\nfilm thickness after proper calibration [Fig. 2(a)] [23, 24].\nThey also studied the dependence of the slurry film thickness\non the type of conditioner disk (design, kinematics, and pres-\nsure) [26] and pad properties (asperities, roughness, and\ngroove) [25]. They measured the in situ coefficient of friction\n(COF) along with slurry film thickness. COF showed an inverse\nrelationship with the average slurry film thickness. In thick and\nmore viscous slurry films, the abrasive particles and the pad are\nless likely to interact with the wafer, resulting in a lower COF.\nThe high viscosity of CMP slurries not only results in ineffec-\ntive mass transport of reactants across the wafer and poor lubri-\ncation between the wafer and the pad but also restricts the\nmovement of abrasive particles in the slurry.\nThe relationship between COF and the slurry film thickness\nis well explained by the Stribeck curve [Fig. 2(b)] [27, 28].By plotting COF against the Hersey number [29], three distinct\nregions \u2014boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication, and hydro-\ndynamic lubrication \u2014were identified. The Hersey number is\ngiven by \u03b7V/Pwhere \u03b7is the slurry viscosity, Vis the relative\nvelocity between pad and wafer, and Pis the pressure. Region\nI of this curve, known as boundary lubrication, shows relatively\nvery high COF due to the direct contact between two solid sur-\nfaces. Region II is referred to as mixed lubrication where the\nwafer does not directly contact a pad because of the slurry\nfilm formed between the wafer and the pad. In Region III\n(hydrodynamic lubrication), the pad and the wafer are fully\nseparated due to the relatively thick slurry film, resulting in a\nrelatively low removal rate and COF.\nMullany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically inves-\ntigated the effect of slurry film thickness on COF during Si\nwafer polishing in the mixed lubrication region [30], showing\nthat the removal rates of the Si wafer decrease with increasing\nHersey number. However, the traditional Stribeck curve fails to\nexplain the lubrication phenomena, while COF and downforce\nfluctuated significantly during polishing because of the\nso-called stick-slip phenomena [31, 32]. Han et al. developed\na Stribeck+ curve involving instantaneous process valuables\n[31, 32] (measured shear force and downforce, calculated,\nand recorded COF), instead of using a constant of shear\nforce and downforce throughout the polishing process, and\nsuccessfully explained the Stribeck+ curves for SiO 2[31], Cu\n[32], and W CMP [32] using various combinations of CMP\nslurries and pads.\nAs mentioned earlier, viscosity is one of the key parameters\nthat control the slurry film thickness and COF [27, 28]. The\nHersey number includes viscosity [29], and it was considered\nas a constant during polishing because most CMP slurries\nbehave as Newtonian fluids displaying a viscosity that is inde-\npendent of shear rate. However, Lortz et al. found that the vis-\ncosity of silica slurries was constant, like Newtonian fluids, only\nup to a shear rate of 10,000 s\u22121and increased significantly for\nhigher shear rates in the range of 200,000 \u2013300,000 s\u22121[33].\nLater, Crawford et al. developed a new methodology to in\nsitu measure the rheological behavior of CMP slurries ( in\nsitu rheo-polishing setup) while polishing the wafer [34].\nThey observed a fivefold increase in the viscosity of the silica\nslurries in the presence of 0.15 M KCl with increasing shear\nrate (\u226510,000 s\u22121). Silica particles can easily form a network\nstructure and agglomerate in an aqueous medium under high\nshear rates due to their strong hydrogen bonding, triggering\na shear-thickening effect [35, 36, 37]. Moreover, in some\ncases, the heat generated by the chemical and mechanical inter-\nactions at the wafer \u2013pad\u2013particle interface can have a signifi-\ncant influence on the slurry viscosity [38]. It usually\ndecreases with increasing temperature. These changes in slurry\nviscosity should be reflected in the Stribeck curve.Review\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 238\nChemical Reactions Between Slurries and\nDielectric Films\nThe mechanical effect alone is not sufficient to explain the\nmaterial removal. Thus, it is essential to understand the chem-\nical reactions of slurry components with the wafer surface dur-\ning polishing. Since a glass-polishing model was first developed\nin the 1980s by Brown et al. [39], various theories and concepts\nhave been proposed to explain the removal of materials during\npolishing. Cook [40] investigated the removal rates of glassusing the slurries composed of various abrasive particles (e.g.,\nalumina, silica, ceria, zirconia, and titania) and found that\nthe ceria particles can interact with the glass surface by forming\nthe strong chemical bonds, which he called as \u201cchemical-tooth \u201d\n[Fig. 3(a)] [41]. In the aqueous medium, the glass surface reacts\nwith water molecules and forms dissolved silanol (Si(OH) 4)a s\nexpressed by (SiO 2)x+2 H 2O\u2194 (SiO 2)x-1+ Si(OH) 4[42].\nAccording to his model, OH groups on the ceria surface\nform strong Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds with silanol groups ( \u2013Si\u2013OH/\u2013\nSi\u2013O\u2212) on the glass surface during polishing [Fig. 3(a)].

The Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds are much stronger\nthan Si \u2013O\u2013Si bonds, which can be removed by both chemical\nreaction and mechanical abrasion during polishing. Later,\nHoshino et al. [43] suggested that SiO 2surfaces are removed\nas the form of lumps of Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds based on Fourier trans-\nform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and inductively coupled\nplasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis of the\npost-CMP slurries [Fig. 3(a)]. Babu \u2019s group studied the effects\nof the Ce oxidation state (Ce3+/Ce4+) on the ceria surface on the\ninteractions with SiO 2film using UV/visible spectroscopy and\nproposed that the surface Ce3+sites stabilized by an oxygen\nvacancy are responsible for the high reactivity with SiO 2film\n[Fig. 3(a)] [44, 45]. They also showed that the reactivity of\nceria particles can be lowered by the blocking of the active\nCe3+surface sites using various additives [45, 46]. Based on\nadsorption isotherms of silicate ions, Seo et al. reported thatceria particles with higher surface Ce3+concentrations have\nhigher adsorption affinity with SiO 2films. Taking advantage\nof these reports, current research for achieving high SiO 2\nremoval rates is aimed at preparing Ce3+rich ceria particles\nthrough either impurity metal-doping or coating. It is well\nknown that lanthanide (La, Sm, Gd, Nd, and Yb) doping can\nincrease Ce3+concentration at the ceria surface, thus enhancing\nthe SiO 2removal rates [47, 48]. Recently, Kim et al. have devel-\noped the core/shell type Ce3+rich ceria abrasive for improved\nSiO 2removal rates [49]. Additionally, by coating the abrasives\nwith a layer of different materials and chemical compositions, it\nis possible to change the physicochemical properties of the core\nabrasives and their reactivity with films [49].\nSi3N4films can be easily oxidized to SiO 2at the surface\nwhen exposed to water or air, and then removed, as in the\ncase of SiO 2films, by chemical reaction (the formation of\nCe\u2013O\u2013Si bonds) as well as mechanical abrasion [50].\nFigure 3: (a) Schematic illustration of SiO 2removal mechanisms and (b) Si 3N4hydrolysis reaction mechanism. Adapted from Ref. [41].

The oxidized surface layer may\nbe further hydrated as silicate species, which is written as\n\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261+H 2O\u2192Si(OH) 4. Laarz et al. [41] and Iler [52]\nshowed that the rate of hydration is strongly affected by slurry\npH, surface area, the preparation method of film, temperature,\netc. Also, Laarz et al. found that the oxidized surface layer on\nSi3N4film behaved like amorphous silica and determined the\nactivation energy (52 kJ/mol) for the hydrolysis of the amor-\nphous surface layer [41]. The conversion process/reaction of\nSi3N4film is important in determining the removal mechanism\nof Si 3N4,and its removal rate [50]. Babu and co-workers inves-\ntigated various amino acids (alpha, cyclic, and aliphatic) that\ncan be preferentially adsorbed onto Si 3N4film, inhibiting its\nhydrolysis to SiO 2[53, 54]. The details of the mechanism of\nSi3N4removal rate suppression will be discussed in detail.\nLater, Alety et al. showed that the removal rate of Si 3N4film\nin the presence of 0.1 wt% ceria particles + 2.3 mM Ce(NO 3)3\nat pH 4 was \u223c300 nm/min, whereas it is \u223c10 nm/min with\nonly ceria particle [55]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of\nthe polished Si 3N4films is similar to that of an as-received sil-\nicon oxynitride film which led them to suggest that, in the pres-\nence of Ce3+, the surface of Si 3N4film can be converted to\nsilicon oxynitride which was then polished at a high rate [55].\nChemical Reactions Between Slurries and\nMetal Films\nUnlike the removal mechanisms of SiO 2and Si 3N4films, metal\nfilms (W, Cu, Ru, Ta, and some of their alloys) are very difficult\nto be polished by only abrasive particles due to their inertness\nand hardness [1]. Kaufman et al. first proposed the polishing\nmechanism of W films when the slurry was composed of fer-\nricyanide, hydrogen phosphate, and ethylenediamine [56]. A\n\u201csoft\u201dpassivating layer forms on the W film in the presence\nof ferricyanide ,[Fe(CN) 6]3\u2212,as an oxidizer, which can be writ-\nten as W + 6[Fe(CN) 6]3\u2212+4 H 2O\u2192WO 42\u2212+ 6[Fe(CN) 6]4\u2212+\n8H+[56]. They proposed that the \u201csoft\u201dpassivation layer can\nbe easily removed by mechanical abrasion, and the fresh\nmetal is exposed to the oxidizer again, which is subsequently\npassivated and then removed [56]. Paul and co-workers pro-\nposed chemical kinetics of W [57] and Cu films [58] as a func-\ntion of oxidizer, chelating agent, inhibitor, and mechanical\ncontribution with a mechanical abrasion process. The passiv-\nation layer MC* forms on the metal film M in the presence\nof chemical component C by the chemical reaction; M +\nC\u2194MC*. The passivation layer can be partially dissolved in\nthe slurries (M bulk+ MC*\u2192MC aq+ M) or removed bymechanical abrasion (MC* + A \u2192MC\u2013A + M) where MC aqis\nthe dissolved species of MC, A is the abrasive particle, and\nMC\u2013A is the leaving material from the metal surface.\nKinetics of competitive reactions of film formation rf=kfNM[C]\nby oxidizer, film dissolution rd=kdNMC* by chelating agent,\nand mechanical abrasion rM=kM(Na/A)NMC* by particles\ndetermine the removal rates of the metal film where kf,kd,\nandkMare the rate constants for the reactions, NMandNMC*\nare the number of M and MC* sites on the metal M surface,\n[C] is the concentration of the chemical component C in the\nslurry and Nais the number of the active abrasive particles\nper unit area Aof the metal surface. Later, Paul and Vacassy\nextended their model to the systems with inhibitor by combin-\ning the reaction and kinetics described above [59]. The mech-\nanism of this process is used to explain other metal CMP\nprocesses, and the possible chemical reactions at the metal sur-\nface are summarized below [60, 61].\nMetal+Oxidizer /shortrightarrowMetal oxide +partially dissolved\nMetal /Metal oxide +Chelating agent\n/shortrightarrowFormation of the insoluble passivating layer or\nDissolved complex ion\nMetal+Inhibitor /shortrightarrowFormationof theinsolublepassivatinglayer\nMetal+H+/OH\u2212/shortrightarrowDissolvedasMn+\nVarious oxidizers such as H 2O2, KIO 3, Fe(NO 3)3,K2S2O8,\nand their mixtures have been investigated [56, 62, 63, 64].\nH2O2has been widely used as an oxidizer for many metal\nCMP slurries due to its low cost and powerful oxidizing capa-\nbility [65, 66]. When both ferric ions and H 2O2are present, fer-\nric ions can lead to the decomposition of H 2O2into the free\nhydroxyl radicals ( \u22c5OH), powerful oxidants, through the\nFenton reaction. These radicals can rapidly form a \u201csoft\u201dpas-\nsivation layer on the metal film, resulting in high MRR and\nimproved topography of metal film [62, 67]. Chelating agents\nsuch as glycine and citric acid that form a complex with\nmetal ions can also help in the material removal by forming\neither insoluble or soluble surface complexes on the metal sur-\nface [68, 69]. However, corrosion defects such as pitting, crack-\ning, and excessive etching will inevitably occur when the metal\nfilms are exposed to corrosive reagents [70]. Organic inhibitors\ncontaining heteroatoms such as O, N, and S have been used to\ninhibit the corrosion of a metal. They can be effectively chem-\nisorbed on the metal surface through the lone pair of electrons\non these heteroatoms. Azole derivatives such as benzotriazole\n(BTAH, often referred to simply as BTA) and 1,2,4-triazole\n(TAZ) have been used as a corrosion inhibitor for the metal\nfilm during polishing, as discussed later in the section on the\ninhibitor.Review\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 241\nThe mechanism of the metal CMP process involving the\ncontinuous cycles of the formation of a passivating layer on\nthe metal film by oxidizer and inhibitor, removal of the passiv-\nating layer by the mechanical action, dissolution by chemical\nreactions, and re-passivation of the metal film is shown in\nFig. 3(c).\nElectrochemical Reactions\nMetal CMP is governed by electrochemical behaviors of metal\nfilms in the presence of oxidizer, complexing agents, and cor-\nrosion inhibitors. When exposed to slurry components, the\nmetal film is oxidized and loses electron, forming metal cation\n(anodic reaction, M = M++e\u2212) and the corresponding cathodic\nreduction reaction receives electrons (O 2+4 H++4 e\u2212=2 H 2O).\nOxidation/dissolution and passivation of metal films occur at\nthe open circuit potential (OCP) of each system [71]. The\nOCP transients stabilize when the anodic and cathodic sites\narrive at a saturation point, and the OCPs and pH values of\nthe slurries are used to predict the thermodynamically stable\nchemical compounds or species of a given metal film in the\nslurry components according to Pourbaix diagrams (or E-pH\ndiagrams). The general E-pH-dependent reaction at 25 \u00b0C\ncan be expressed as a(Ox) + mH++ne\u2212\u2194b(Rd) + cH2O\nwhere a,m,b, and care the number of molecules, nis the num-\nber of electrons involved in the reaction, and Ox and Rd denote\nthe oxidized and reduced species of the active redox couple,\nrespectively. E-pH diagrams were constructed by using the\nNernst equation and appropriate equilibrium constantexpressions [72]: E=E0\u2013(2.303 RTm )/(nF)pH +(2.303 RT/nF)\nlog(COxa/CRdb)w h e r e Eis the actual cell potential at nonstan-\ndard condition, E0is the standard reduction potential, Ris the\ngas constant, Tis the absolute temperature, Fis the Faraday\nconstant, and COxand CRdrepresent the concentration of the\nspecies Ox and Rd involved in the E-pH-dependent reactions.\nPourbaix diagrams for various metal \u2013slurry systems for CMP\napplications have been developed [73].\nA goal of metal CMP is to uniformly polish the intercon-\nnection materials (Cu, Co, Al, W, etc.) and the barrier materials\n(Ta, TaN, Ti, TiN, Co, Ru, etc.) with the desired removal rates\nand selectivity while minimizing CMP-related defects such as\nlocalized pitting, dissolution, and galvanic corrosion, and\nstop on the oxide layer. The interconnection materials and\nthe barrier materials are in physical contact, and the polishing\nslurry provides a conductive pathway between them. According\nto mixed potential theory, two metals with different potentials\nare polarized until they reach the same potential, forming a gal-\nvanic couple. The more noble metal becomes a cathode for the\noxygen reduction reaction, and the less noble metal is corroded\nmore rapidly through dissolution/oxidation while supplying\nelectrons to the cathode, resulting in the preferential dissolu-\ntion/corrosion of either interconnection material or barrier\nmaterial by galvanic corrosion (Fig. 4) [73]. Corrosion param-\neters ( Ecorr,Icorr,Eg, and Ig) obtained from Tafel extrapolations\nprovide useful information on the oxidation \u2013reduction reac-\ntions of metal films in the slurry. Chemical additives induce\nthe shifts in the Ecorrand the Icorrby the complex mechanism.\nAn upward shift of Tafel curves can occur due to anodic\nFigure 4: Galvanic corrosion of metal-barrier couple due to their potential difference.

A downward\nshift in Tafel plots is observed with the addition of the cathodic\ninhibitor by retarding the rate of oxygen transfer to the\ncathodic sites on the metal films. It is necessary to minimize\nthe potential difference of the metal/barrier couple with low\ncorrosion currents through a careful selection of oxidizer, com-\nplexing agent, corrosion inhibitor, and the slurry pH. Cu metal\nand Ru barrier act as the anode and cathode of the galvanic\ncouple, respectively. Galvanic corrosion of Cu \u2013Ru couple\nneeds to be controlled through the selective prevention of\ncathodic reactions on Ru film, and/or increasing the potential\nof Cu by preferential anodic inhibition of Cu films. Peethala\net al. [74] proposed a silica-based slurry containing 5 mM\nBTA and 7 mM ascorbic acid at pH 9 in the presence of\nKIO 4, as an oxidizer as selective anodic and cathodic corrosion\ninhibitors for Cu and Ru films, respectively. The mixed corro-\nsion inhibitor system not only minimized the galvanic corrosion\nof Cu \u2013Ru couple but also achieved a reasonable removal rate\nselectivity of Cu and Ru films. Chockalingam et al. [75] showed\nthat 2 mM BTA and 3 mM sucrose in the presence of KIO 4at\npH 10 were able to suppress both anodic and cathodic reaction\nof Cu and Mn films by forming a passivation layer on the films,\nleading to minimizing the individual corrosion of films as well as\ntheir galvanic corrosion. Jiang et al. [76] showed that the combi-\nnation of BTA and Pluronic\u00ae P103 in the presence of KIO 4at pH\n9.5 formed a compact passivation layer, composed of Pluronic\u00ae\nP103 adsorbed on the Cu-BTA complex, resulting in the desired\nCu removal rate \u223c200 \u00c5/min with the negligible dissolution and\nexcellent surface quality. This slurry composition was also very\neffective in the control of the removal rates of Cu, Ru, and\nlow-kdielectric films and their selectivity, but the galvanic cor-\nrosion of Cu/Ru couple needed to be reduced for improved sur-\nface quality when Ru is used as the barrier layer.\nAdsorption Behavior and Mechanism of\nSlurry Components on Abrasive\nParticles and Films\nOrganic compounds such as dispersants and passivation agents\nin CMP slurries have been used to stabilize the slurry and\nachieve the selective removal of the materials during polishing,\nrespectively. The most common functional groups of disper-\nsants and passivation agents used in CMP slurries are carbox-\nylic acids (COOH) and amines (NH 2). Chemical adsorption\nbetween the adsorbate and the surface occurs through various\ninteractions such as electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and\nhydrophobic interactions [77]. Electrostatic interaction is rele-\nvant for ionic species and involves the attractive electrostatic\nforces between opposite charges. Hydrogen bonding occurs\nwhen electronegative atoms such as O, S, or N approach a\nhydrogen atom bound to another electronegative atom. It ispossible for organic compounds containing electronegative\ngroups such as \u2013OH, \u2013O\u2013,\u2013NH, and \u2013NH 2to adsorb onto\n-OH groups of the hydrated surface of particles and films\nthrough hydrogen bonding.\nAdsorption Behavior and Mechanism of\nDispersants on Abrasive Particles\nPoly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and copolymers, anionic polymers,\nhave been widely used as dispersants for ceria slurries [78,\n79]. When added to the slurry, the COOH groups of PAA\nare deprotonated to negatively charged COO\u2212groups above\nits pKa of 4.5 and adsorb on the highly positively charged\nceria surface (OH 2+sites) viaelectrostatic attractive interaction\nand hydrogen bonding [Fig. 5(a)] [80], which increases\nFigure 5: (a) Schematic illustration depicting PAA interactions at the ceria/\nSi3N4\u2013slurry interface as a function of pH and corresponding potential-distance\ndiagrams.

PAA coated ceria particles are known to\nundergo transitions of bridging agglomeration-stable-floccula-\ntion depending on their physicochemical conditions such as\npH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration [81].\nCitric acid and PAA have been used to disperse alumina abra-\nsives [82, 83]. Song et al. suggested that the mixed dispersant\nsystem of citric acid and PAA was very useful for the stable dis-\npersion of alumina abrasives, leading to higher Cu removal\nrates by suppressing the hydration of alumina abrasive [84].\nIonic surfactants such as ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS)\nand cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) have been\nused in the formation of ceria slurries reported by\nDylla-Spears et al. [85]. They suggested that the formation of\ncharged micelles above the critical micelle concentration may\nelectro-sterically hinder the agglomeration of ceria particles,\nwhich is called the \u201ccharged micelle halo \u201dstabilization mecha-\nnism [85].\nTseng et al. [86] reported that the silica abrasives in the\npresence of methyl methacrylate were stabilized by either elec-\ntrostatic barriers or steric barriers between the particles, result-\ning in an excellent uniformity of the oxide thickness across the\nwafer. Pan et al. [87] suggested that sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS), an anionic surfactant, could improve the dispersion\nstability of silica-based slurries for Cu CMP. Indeed, free SDS\nsurfactants remaining in the slurry were very useful to suppress\nCu corrosion and lead to good surface quality.\nPolyethylenimine (PEI) and CTAB composed of the amine\ngroups were used to disperse silica abrasive particles also [88,\n89]. They can be adsorbed onto the negatively charged silica\nthrough electrostatic attractive interaction as well as hydrogen\nbonding and prevent agglomeration. However, the adsorbed\nlayer on the particle surface results in the low material removal\nrate by preventing particles from direct contact with the mate-\nrials to be polished.\nAdsorption Behavior and Mechanism of\nPassivation Agents on Films\nPAA, when used as a passivation agent during polishing, can be\npreferentially adsorbed on the positively charged Si 3N4film\n(pH IEP\u223c5\u20137) through electrostatic attraction [Fig. 5(a)] [80],\nsuppressing the removal of Si 3N4film and yielding high selec-\ntivity [90]. Kim et al. reported that PAA has almost ten times\nhigher affinity with Si 3N4at pH 5 \u20139 than with SiO 2[91]. The\npreferential adsorption of PAA on Si 3N4films was confirmed\nby attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectra of SiO 2\nand Si 3N4surfaces treated with PAA. Kim et al. measured\nthe thickness of adsorbed PAA on the Si 3N4film using atomic\nforce microscopy as a function of ionic strength [92]. The\nthickness of the adsorbed PAA layers on the Si 3N4film was5.2, 4.5, and 3.8 nm with 0, 0.2, and 0.4 M KNO 3, respectively.\nIn some case, if the attractive forces such as hydrogen bonding\nare more dominant than the electrostatic repulsion between\nPAA and SiO 2film, it is possible for the adsorption of PAA\nto occur on the SiO 2film [93].\nPark et al. investigated the effect of adding both PAA and\npoly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) to ceria based slurries to achieve\nthe multi-selectivity between SiO 2,S i3N4, and poly-Si films and\nshowed high selectivity ( \u223c65:\u223c15:1 for SiO 2:Si3N4:poly-Si\nfilms) in the presence of 0.05 wt% PAA and 0.2 wt% PVP in\nthe pH range of 6.0 \u20136.5 [94]. Seo et al. proposed the\nPAA-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) \u201cinterpolymer complexes \u201d\nas a passivation agent for high selectivity with low dishing\nand reported that the cross-linked network structure of inter-\npolymer complexes significantly reduced dishing by preventing\nabrasives from polishing oxide in the trenches [95].\nAmerica and Babu [53] proposed that the COOH group of\nthe amino acid proline can form a bidentate interaction with\nthe Si \u2013OH group on Si 3N4film along with H-bonding between\nthe amino acid and Si 3N4film [Fig. 5(b)]. The bidentate bond-\ning is observed where two or more hydrogen bonds are formed\nwith a base or base pair. More generally, many amino acids\nwere able to suppress the removal rates of Si 3N4film through\nthe prevention of the hydrolysis of the Si 3N4as long as there\nare available in sufficient amounts during polishing. Since\namino acids can also be adsorbed on the abrasive particles,\nfree amino acids remaining in the solution must be of sufficient\nquantity for effective suppression of Si 3N4film removal rates.\nSince these amino acids are sensitive to a change of pH, the\nslurry pH needs to be optimized based on their pKa values\n[54, 96].\nHydrophobic interaction involves the adsorption of the\nnonpolar groups of organic molecules such as a hydrocarbon\nbackbone ( \u2013CH 2\u2212CH 2\u2212) onto hydrophobic surfaces. Penta\net al. [97] investigated four different anionic surfactants and\nshowed that these negatively charged surfactants could prefer-\nentially adsorb on positively charged Si 3N4film viaelectrostatic\ninteractions. A monolayer of anionic surfactants is formed by\nelectrostatic attraction between surfactants and Si 3N4, followed\nby a secondary layer by hydrophobic interaction between the\nhydrophobic tails of anionic surfactants, suppressing Si 3N4\nremoval rates. Nonionic surfactants that can preferentially\nadsorb on the hydrophobic poly-Si surface viahydrophobic\ninteraction for preferential removal of SiO 2over poly-Si were\nstudied by Lee et al. [98], and there was a strong dependence\nof the selectivity on the hydrophilic \u2013lipophilic balance value\nand molecular weight of nonionic surfactants.\nMetal films are prone to dissolve when exposed to reactive\ncomponents in the slurry, and corrosion inhibitors are added to\nprevent the corrosion defects such as pitting, cracking, and\nexcessive etching during polishing. Most of the inhibitorsReview\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 244\nstudied for CMP applications are organic compounds contain-\ning N, S, and O atoms [99]. A metal cation can interact with\naromatic rings containing conjugated bonds, \u03c0electrons, and\nlone-pair electrons from heteroatoms (O, N, or S). The effi-\nciency of heteroatoms in the inhibitor molecules increases in\nthe order of O < N < S. The corrosion inhibition of metal\nfilms involves either physisorption or chemisorption of the\ninhibitor on the metal surface. Electrostatic attractive force\nbetween the charged inhibitor molecules and the charged\nmetal surface leads to physisorption. Chemisorption is due to\nthe interaction between unshared electron pairs of the hetero-\natom and metal atoms to form coordinate covalent bonds. The\nstandard adsorption free energy ( \u0394G\u00b0ads) can provide insight\ninto the mechanism of corrosion inhibition. The \u0394G\u00b0adsvalues\nabove \u221220 kJ/mol and below \u221240 kJ/mol correspond to the\nphysisorption and chemisorption process, respectively.\nAnodic inhibitors reduce the corrosion potential of metal\nfilms by oxidizing a surface layer and forming a thin passivat-\ning film on the metal. Cathodic inhibitors suppress the\ncathodic reaction (O 2+2 H 2O+4 e\u2212= 4OH\u2212) by retarding the\nrate of oxygen transfer to the cathodic sites on the metal sur-\nface. Molecules with aliphatic chains are effective in suppress-\ning the corrosion of metal films due to the attraction of\nnonpolar hydrophobic parts of inhibitor and polar medium\n[99]. The hydrophobic parts of inhibitors form a protective\nlayer on the metal surface. Their size and molecular weight\nhave an impact on the inhibition efficiency [100]. Larger the\nmolecule, higher inhibition efficiency: R 3N>R 2NH > RNH 2,\nwhere R is a hydrocarbon chain.\nAzole derivatives such as BTA and TAZ have been widely\nused as corrosion inhibitors for metal films during polishing\n[Fig. 5(c)] [101, 102, 103]. BTA can be adsorbed onto a Cu\nfilm by the coordination of the lone-pair electrons of the N\natoms in BTA [Fig. 5(c)] with the Cu atoms on the surface\n[104, 105]. Xue et al. suggested that BTAH reacts with metallic\nCu much faster than on Cu oxide and forms a polymeric pas-\nsivating layer for Cu film than for copper oxides [105]. Also,\nthey showed that Cu could be oxidized to Cu(I) in the presence\nof dissolved oxygen and form a Cu(I)BTA complex with BTA:\n4Cu + 4BTAH + 2O 2\u2194Cu(I)BTA + 2H 2O [105].\nAlthough surfactants such as CTAB [106], ammonium\ndodecyl sulfate [65], and potassium oleate [107] were also\ninvestigated as corrosion inhibitors, BTA is the most common\ncorrosion inhibitor used in CMP slurries. In any case, all these\ninhibitors can complex with metal ions and remain stable on\nthe metal film as undesirable organic residues [108], and it\nhas been very difficult to remove these organic residues during\npost-CMP cleaning [109, 110]. So, post-CMP cleaning has\nbecome essential to remove these organic residues from the\nfilms while minimizing other defects (e.g., residual particles,\nforeign materials, scratches, and corrosion). Figure 6 shows asummary of the adsorption of organic compounds such as dis-\npersants, passivation agents, and inhibitors on the abrasive par-\nticles and the wafer surfaces in the CMP system.\nTemperature Effects\nThe major sources of thermal heating during polishing are fric-\ntional dissipation and the chemical reactions of slurry compo-\nnents at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface, leading to a change in\ntemperature. Various thermal models of the polishing process\nbased on kinematics [111], energy generation [112], and a\ncombination of frictional heating and chemical reactivity\n[113] were proposed. Infrared thermography was used to char-\nacterize the impact of thermal effects on pad life, polishing rate,\nand non-uniformity during polishing. Wang et al. [114]\nreported that the exothermic reaction between the metal sur-\nface and the oxidizers in the acidic environment could increase\nthe temperature up to 75 \u00b0C during polishing depending on\nCMP conditions, which was lowered by the slurry flow.\nWhite et al. [112] proposed an energy flow mechanism into\nand out of the process, and an energy balance was used to pre-\ndict an increase in the slurry temperature during polishing.\nThey suggested that the heat is generated by the mechanical\nabrasion and the chemical reactions associated with the slurry\nchemistry and enthalpy is primarily transferred into the polish-\ning pad, and then, most of the heat will be removed by convec-\ntion of slurry flow, conduction, and radiation to the\nenvironment [112]. Oh and Seok [113] suggested that frictional\nheat generated during polishing is transferred to the wafer, pad,\nand slurry, and plays a key role in accelerating the chemical\nreactions at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface. Their theoretical\nresults showed that the temperature variation of the wafer,\npad, and slurry has an influence on material removal rates.\nIndeed, the temperature rise of the CMP process not only\nhas an effect on the slurry viscosity, pH, particle size, and zeta-\npotential [30, 115, 116] but also leads to delamination or peel-\noff of the metal films [70, 117]. For example, a 5 \u00b0C change in\ntemperature can lead to a 10% drop in slurry viscosity [30].\nKakireddy reported that thin Cu film peeled off during polish-\ning at higher temperatures due to lower adhesion and mechan-\nical strength [117].\nThe Effect of Temperature Changes on the\nChemical and Mechanical Reactions\nduring Polishing\nAs stated earlier, the scope of this review paper is limited to\nCMP slurries and related to chemical and mechanical aspects\nof the CMP process, although other CMP consumables such\nas pad, pad conditioner, wafer carrier, and retaining ring and\nCMP conditions need to be considered. Figure 7 shows aReview\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 245\nsimplified scheme of the complex interactions between chemi-\ncal and mechanical aspects of the CMP process discussed in\nthis review paper. It is important to emphasize that Fig. 7\nhelps in understanding the complex interactions between\nchemical and mechanical effects that occur at the pad \u2013wafer \u2013\nparticle interface during polishing.\n(i) Case I: The materials or wafers are removed by the\nsynergetic effects of chemical and mechanical interaction\nduring polishing. The energy dissipation due to frictional\nheating is responsible for increases in the temperaturesdduring polishing. The average temperature of slurry\nincreased up to 75 \u00b0C during the W CMP process, and\nWang et al. suggested that the oxidation of W film causes\nthe temperature increase because this reaction is\nexothermic [114]. Also, in some cases, chemical reactions\nlike the Fenton reaction are spontaneous exothermic\nprocesses, contribute to temperature increase during\npolishing.\n(ii) Case II: As is well known, with increasing temperature of\nthe system, the rates of chemical reactions increase [118],\nleading to higher removal rates [116, 119, 120]. Kim et al.Figure 6: An overview of the adsorp-\ntion of organic compounds such as\ndispersants, passivation agents, and\ninhibitors on the abrasive particles\nand the wafer surfaces.\nFigure 7: Schematic representation of the complex interactions between chemical and mechanical effects in the actual CMP system.Review\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 246\nreported that the slurries at higher temperatures lead to\nthe formation of the soft layers on the surface of SiO 2film,\nand this layer could be easily removed by mechanical\nabrasion [116, 119]. Mudhivarthi et al. found that an\nincrease in the surface oxidation/dissolution rate of Cu\nfilm, resulting in higher Cu removal rates [120]. The\ncorrosion rate of metal films increases with increasing the\ntemperature, leading to a decrease in the inhibition\nefficiency.\nMoreover, an increase in temperature not only leads to\nchanges in the polymer chain conformation (coiled\ntransformed to stretched) [121] but also causes changes in\nthe zeta-potentials and the pH IEPof abrasive particles and\nfilms [122], which have an influence on the adsorbed\namounts and thickness of dispersants and passivation\nagents.\n(iii) Case III: Since the formation of hydrogen ions and\nhydroxide ions from water (H 2O\u2194H++OH\u2212)i sa n\nendothermic process, the water dissociates to H+and OH\u2212\nas the temperature increases. The slurry pH decreases with\nincreasing H+concentration at a higher temperature. Kim\net al. reported that the change ( \u0394pH) in the pH of silica\nand ceria slurries as the temperature increased from 20 to\n90 \u00b0C was \u223c1.0 and \u223c1.3, respectively [116, 119]. It is well\nknown that a change in pH of slurry has a significant\ninfluence on the particle \u2013wafer interactions [123, 124].\nAlso, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases with\nincreasing temperature [125]. For example, 10.07 mg/L of\noxygen can be dissolved in the water at 15 \u00b0C, while\n7.54 mg/L of oxygen can be dissolved in the water at 30 \u00b0C\n[125]. The change in the dissolved oxygen concentrations\ncan affect the oxidation and dissolution process of metal\nfilms and the surface chemistry of abrasive particles as\nwell as their mutual interactions [3].\n(iv) Case IV: The hydrodynamic size ( Rh) of abrasive particles\ncan be determined by the Stokes \u2013Einstein relation; Rh=\nkT/6\u03c0\u03b7Dwhere k,T,\u03b7, and Drepresent Boltzmann \u2019s\nconstant, temperature, water viscosity, and the diffusion\ncoefficient. Since the equation includes the viscosity of the\nfluid medium (in our case, water) and the temperature,\nboth parameters strongly influence on the hydrodynamic\nsize of particles. Indeed, the viscosity of the water \u03b7\ndecreases with increasing temperature ( Case V ) [126].\nZeta potentials of the abrasive particles increase with\ntemperature. Zeta potentials of particles can be obtained\nindirectly from the measurement of the electrophoretic\nmobility according to Henry \u2019s equation; UE=2e\u03b6F(\u03baa)/3\u03b7\nwhere UEis the electrophoretic mobility, eis the relative\npermittivity of water, and F(\u03baa) is Henry \u2019s function\n(dimensionless). For particles in an aqueous medium,\nF(\u03baa) is 1.5 according to the Smoluchowskiapproximation. The variation of zeta potential of abrasive\nparticles with temperature is explained by the known\ntemperature dependence of the viscosity ( \u03b7) and the\nrelative permittivity ( e) of water. Evenhuis et al. reported\nthat experimentally determined values of zeta-potential\nwere directly proportional to the temperature [122]. Kim\net al. also showed an increase in the zeta-potentials of\ncommercial ceria slurries with increasing slurry\ntemperatures [116]. It may be possible for the number of\nactive particles that participate in material removal during\npolishing to be changed depending on the particle size\nand zeta potentials of the abrasive particles.\n(v) Case V, VI, and VII: The viscosity of the slurry is a\nmeasure of its resistance to deformation by shear forces.\nHigh slurry viscosity impedes the transport of the slurry\ncomponents across the wafer surface. As the temperature\nof liquid increases, the viscosity of slurry decreases ( Case\nV), and the reactant molecules move faster ( Case VI ).\nAlso, according to the Stribeck curve [Fig. 2(b)] [27, 28], a\ndecrease in the slurry viscosity at a higher temperature\nmay allow the direct contact between two solid films with\na thin slurry film thickness resulting in an increase in COF\nduring polishing.\nIn Situ Techniques to Study the\nPhenomena that Occur at the\nSlurry/pad \u2013wafer Interface during\nPolishing\nResearch in the field of CMP has significantly increased, as the\nsemiconductor industry grows. Numerous experimental tech-\nniques have been employed to understand particle \u2013film\u2013\nwafer interactions, but they are not adapted for in situ and real-\ntime detection during polishing due to their dimensions and\noperating requirements. The actual CMP system includes the\nmutual interactions between chemical and mechanical effects.\nIn situ measurement data collected during polishing are likely\nto provide more important insights into the underlying mech-\nanisms of various complex reactions that occur at the slurry/\npad\u2013wafer interface. This section offers an overview of\nadvances in the research and developments of in situ measure-\nment studies in CMP systems and then discusses the challenges\nassociated with these measurements. Table 2 presents a sum-\nmary of in situ measurements applied in CMP systems while\nhighlighting the main applications for each technique.\nSlurry film thickness was in situ monitored by analyzing\nthe fluorescence intensities of the two different dye molecules\nin the slurry using a dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence\ntechnique with a dual-camera imaging system [Fig. 2(a);\nTable 2] as described in the Hydrodynamic lubrication sectionReview\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 247\n[23, 24]. Mueller et al. [127] used tracer particles to study fluid\nflow characteristics over pad asperities and recorded a video at\n30 frames/s using high definition camera to obtain in situ\nslurry fluid flow data during polishing (Table 2) and manually\nanalyzed the qualitative information of the slurry flow charac-\nteristics from the video. This tool and method enable to study\nwafer-scale slurry flow visualization depending on CMP condi-\ntions, slurry injection locations, and various pad types [127].\nThe studies that used dyes or tracer particles contain valuable\ninformation on slurry film thickness and flow characteristics\n[23, 24, 127]. However, these particles added to the slurry\nmay not only have a significant influence on the chemical\nand mechanical reactions during polishing but also become\nembedded in the pad due to the hydrophobic interactions\n[127]. Moreover, the materials to be polished are limited to\ntransparent glasses over UV and visible regions.\nIn situ rheo-polishing setup with a parallel-plate geometry\nwas developed by Crawford et al. [Fig. 8(a); Table 2] [34]. The\ntop was constructed of a disposable plate, while a 2-in diameter\nSiO 2blanket wafer was inserted into the fixture housing with\n2 mL of slurry. The gap between the top plate and the wafer\nsurface was 30 \u03bcm, which allowed for shear rates up to 200,\n000 s\u22121. In some cases, shear-induced aggregation of particles,\nless than 2% of the total number of particles, was found at a\nhigh shear rate ( \u226510,000 s\u22121). Shear thickened samples gener-\nated about seven times more scratches on the wafer surface\nthan non-thickened slurries. However, as they mentioned,\nthis method not only has no applied normal force but also is\nincapable of measuring the real changes in slurry viscosity\nwith rolling friction [34].\nTakaya et al. have developed a custom-built Raman spec-\ntrometer to study various interactions of Cu-abrasive, abrasive-\nperoxide, BTA-peroxide, and BTA-abrasive-peroxide (Table 2)\n[128]. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) systemis an amplification technique that enhances Raman signal\nfrom molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces. 25 nm\nthick Cu film deposited on 10 mm glass was used as a substrate\nfor SERS measurements, and it is immersed in the glass cell\nfilled with the slurry. Their SERS analysis results for\nBTA-abrasive-peroxide suggested that both Cu-BTA and Cu\n(II)-fullerenol-complex layers are formed on the Cu surface\nsimultaneously, and these layers may inhibit the further inter-\nactions of chelating agents and oxidizer with Cu film [128].\nHowever, this method is also limited to only chemical reactions\nwithout mechanical effects. Since the actual metal polishing\nsystem includes the kinetics of competitive reactions between\noxidizer, chelating agent, and inhibitor when the passivating\nlayers were removed by mechanical abrasion, mechanical abra-\nsion and slurry flow system, which need to be considered to get\nmore realistic results.\nThe ATR-FTIR technique for the in situ characterization of\nCMP using micro-structured single reflection elements\n(mSREs) was developed by U. K\u00fcnzelmann and\nH. Schumacher (Table 2) [129]. They fabricated the micro-\nstructure, consists of a periodic array of V-shaped grooves on\nthe backside of a double-side polished 4-in Si wafer with\n525\u03bcm thickness by wet etch in hot KOH solution, which is\nmSRE. This element not only enables to provide single reflec-\ntion ATR measurement without any collimation but also covers\nthe entire mid-infrared region with a high optical throughput\ndue to the short light path [129]. The coupling structures of\nthe mSRE face downwards, and the pad is pressed from its\nupper side and rotated against the static mSRE, while the slurry\nwas injected between at the wafer \u2013pad interface. With the\ndepth around 1 \u03bcm, this technique enables to an in situ analysis\nof the deposition, etching, and surface modification of wafer,\npad, and abrasives during polishing [129]. In situ ATR-FTIR\nspectra of the actual CMP system are very complex and thusTABLE 2.

EW microscopy, also known as total internal reflection\nmicroscopy, coupled with video microscopy was employed to\nfollow the movements of particles near the glass \u2013pad interface.\nIn their experimental setup, an EW was generated when the\nlaser light beam having 30 mW power at 632 nm wavelength\n(He\u2013Ne laser) undergoes total internal reflection at a glass \u2013\nslurry interface and propagated parallel to the surface with an\nexponentially decaying intensity [130]. The EW illuminates\nthe particles present in the slurry and has a penetration\ndepth ( \u223c100 nm) in an imaged area of 480 \u00d7 640 mm2.\nThe frame rate of the digital high-speed video camera was60 frames/s (fps). They suggested that the abrasive particles\nadhered to the Si(OH) 4layer on the SiO 2film were removed\nby slurry flow, which yields the material removal. They also\nreported that the actual contact area between the pad and the\nwafer is less than 2%, and suggested that the significant mate-\nrial removal is caused due to the non-contact lubrication effect\n[132]. Since Kimura et al. showed a home-built EW imaging\nsystem coupled with polishing setup, many research groups\nhave developed different methods to monitor in situ and in\nreal-time the interactions between particle, pad, and wafer dur-\ning post-CMP cleaning as well as polishing [133, 134]. Abrasive\nparticles move far away rapidly from the glass surface by the\nslurry flow and the platen rotation and sometimes disappear\nfrom the field of view, preventing long-term particle tracking\nin the EW field. Moreover, the smaller particles, less than\n100 nm particles used in the actual CMP system, scatter less\nlight making them more challenging to detect using EW\nFigure 8: (a) Rheo-polishing setup with plate fixture and 40 mm upper plate, and schematic of the cross-sectional view of the rheometer plate and tetraethyl\northosilicate (TEOS) wafer covered with CMP slurry.

Thus, more light needs to be collected by the\nobjective lens to make the imaging of smaller particles possible.\nLocal material removal phenomena were in situ observed by\ninfrared thermography (Table 2) [131]. Frictional heating is\nresponsible for increases in the temperature during polishing.\nData were obtained from an infrared image sensor with the infra-\nred light collected through a small hole fabricated on the wafer\ncarrier during polishing. An increase in the temperature is related\nto material removal efficiency. The feasibility of the in situ obser-\nvation of the polishing efficiency was confirmed by the polishing\nexperiment with a polishing pad. According to Isobe \u2019sp o l i s h i n g\nmodel [136], they suggested that the in situ detection of instanta-\nneous temperature variations depending on Feret \u2019sd i a m e t e r so f\nthe contact area between the pad and the wafer, leading to higher\nmaterial removal rate [131]. As they mentioned, it is very difficult\nto directly measure the change in the temperature at the particle \u2013\nwafer \u2013pad interface due to the limitation of the proposed\nmethod. Also, the system needs to apply fresh slurry to the\npad\u2013wafer interface and remove warm slurry after polishing\nthat passed under the carrier to avoid heat accumulation.\nRoy\u2019s group reported an electrochemical measurement cou-\npled with a Struers Benchtop Polisher [60]. The top part of the\nsystem contains a 1-in diameter coupon wafer as a working\nelectrode embedded in a Teflon holder attached to the polish-\ning head. And the bottom part is a Teflon container attached to\nthe platen. Electrical connection to the working electrode and\nthe counter electrode was made through carbon brushes\npressed against Cu ring surrounding Teflon holder (Top) and\nTeflon container (bottom), respectively. The reference electrode\nequipped with a salt bridge connects to the electrolyte. This\nsystem enables to in situ measure OCP transients and potentio-\ndynamic polarization for the metal film under controlled tribo-\nlogical conditions. Roy \u2019s group demonstrated that the tribology\nand mechanical abrasion affects various catalytic reactions of Cu,\nRu, Ta, and Co surfaces during polishing by evaluating CMP\nsystems in the tribo-electrochemical approach [60, 137, 138].\nIn situ measurements are taken in real-time during polish-\ning and can be interpreted immediately. Moreover, in situ mea-\nsurements can give more representative information of CMP\nslurry characteristics, including various chemical and mechan-\nical actions that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface during\npolishing when compared with the ex situ analysis of CMP\nslurries. However, as stated above, there are still several limita-\ntions that need to be addressed. Additional studies and in situ\ntechniques will be helpful to understand the underlying mech-\nanism taking place during the CMP process.\nChallenges and Future Directions\n(i)Development of CMP slurries for new materials and\nintegration schemes: As the scaling of the devicedimensions runs into physical limitations, 3D integration,\n3D NAND technology, and FinFET structure were\nemployed by using new materials and processes [139,\n140]. As the architectures have changed from 2D planar to\n3D vertical, new CMP steps involving new materials and\ncomplex 3D structures were proposed. Successful\nimplementation of these schemes required developing\nnovel CMP slurries and other consumables to achieve a\nrange of tunable polish rates for new materials based on\ntheir characteristics such as stoichiometry, surface\nchemistry, hardness, chemical inertness or sensitivity, and\nthickness. A systematic and effective approach needs to be\nadopted to achieve the necessary high polishing\nperformance, selective polishing, high planarity, low\ndefects, etc. The research strategies, suggested by the\nauthor, for developing next-generation CMP slurries, are\nsummarized in Fig. 9.\n(ii)Defect reduction and post-CMP cleaning : Devices at 7 nm\nnode and beyond present even more stringent\nrequirements for the level of acceptable defectivity during\nthe CMP process. The processes become more defect\nsensitive and require more expensive metrology\ntechniques with appropriate optical resolution to detect\nthe smaller defects. CMP-induced defects caused by\nresidual particles, foreign materials, scratches, corrosion,\netc. should be avoided during polishing. Since this is not\nalways possible, post-CMP cleaning has become a crucial\nstep to eliminate many of these defects [141, 142, 143,\n144]. Recently, the author not only showed that the\nrupture of a strong chemical bonding between abrasive\nparticles and the SiO 2films viaa nucleophilic attack could\nhelp remove the particles from the surface [141] but also\nreported a stability constant-based strategy to study\nreagents that can remove Cu-BTA and Co-BTA complexes\nfrom various surfaces (Cu, Co, TaN, and SiO 2films) [109,\n110]. Fundamental understanding of the formation and\ncharacterization of various types of CMP-induced defects\nwill immensely benefit the development of next-generation\nCMP slurries and post-CMP cleaning solutions.\n(iii) Development of environmentally friendly CMP\nslurries: Azoles such as BTA and TAZ are not only poorly\nbiodegradable under wastewater treatment conditions but\nalso lead to watermarks on the wafer surfaces and\ncontamination of various surfaces under CMP conditions.\nThe effluent wastewater from a semiconductor fabrication\nplant may contain high concentrations of azoles, etc., and\nwill be challenging for wastewater treatment processes.\nHence, the chemical additives that effectively passivate\nmetal surfaces and exhibit sufficiently high biodegradation\nrates need to be considered keeping their environmental\nimpact in mind.Review\nJournal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 250\n(iv) Toxicity issues and safety considerations [145, 146] Toxic\ngases (e.g., PH 3, AsH 3) and the As containing waste\nslurries can be generated during the polishing of III \u2013V\nmaterials such as GaAs, InGaAs, InAs, and InP. Hence,\nthe goal of the polishing of III \u2013V materials should be\nachieving high planarity without generating toxic\nby-products. In the acidic pH, Ru film can be converted to\nhighly volatile RuO 4, a toxic gas. The addition of\ncomplexing agents such as carboxylic acids can help to\nreduce gas evolution during polishing. This is an example\nof tailoring slurry chemistry to minimize the formation of\ntoxic by-products through a careful selection of oxidizer,\ncomplexing agent, corrosion inhibitor, and the slurry pH.\nTetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), a strong\norganic base, is also one of the materials showing a high\nlevel of concern. TMAH has been widely used as a\ndeveloper, cleaning agent, pH adjuster, and etchant in the\nsemiconductor industry, but it can cause fatal damage to\nnerves and muscles in a short period after exposure by\ncontact [147]. Hence, there has been increasing demand\nto develop less toxic substitutes for TMAH and\nimprove/control the use of TMAH.\nAs stated earlier, the challenges and future research directions\ndiscussed here were related to CMP slurries and related to\nchemical and mechanical aspects of the CMP process. There\nhas been significant progress in understanding the fundamental\nscience and technology of CMP for the past several decades.\nNevertheless, most of the models, methodologies, and tech-\nniques generally use laboratory-scale model systems under\nthe assumptions about process parameters, which may ormay not be relevant to explain high-volume-production fab-\nbased CMP processes [148]. A close collaboration between aca-\ndemic and industrial R&D will help us to move forward with\nunderstanding the fundamental principles and technologies\nof the actual CMP process by minimizing the gaps between lab-\nbased CMP models and fab-based CMP processes.\nAcknowledgment\nThe author gratefully acknowledges Prof. S.V.

We have focused on the e\ufb00ects of particle size distribution, the large-particle size, and the dispersion stability in a ceria slurry. We determined the optimum bead size for milling and appropriatecalcination temperatures in order to obtain a reasonable particle distribution, with lower numbers of \ufb01ne primary particles and\nlarge, agglomerated particles, in ceria slurry. This was achieved by reducing the quantity of aggregated particles during\nmilling and two-step calcination process generating higher-density particles. These results can be qualitatively explained byabrasive collisions occurring between the milling beads and the decarbonation of cerium carbonate through di\ufb00usion during\nthe manufacturing process used for the ceria slurry. [DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.46.7671 ]\nKEYWORDS: calcination, milling, light point defect, ceria slurry, STI-CMP\n1. Introduction\nThe shallow-trench isolation (STI) process in advanced\nsemiconductor device manufacturing uses chemical\u2013mechanical polishing (CMP) to planarize gap-\ufb01ll siliconoxide (SiO\n2) layers deposited on the front-side surface of a\nwafer.1\u20134)As device dimensions continue to decrease and the\nleading-edge feature size becomes smaller than 0.1 mm, STI-\nCMP must be capable of removing a very thin layer of oxideand nitride while leaving a \ufb02at surface. In STI-CMP, theselectivity of the removal rates of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms is acritical factor. Moreover, as the oxide and nitride layersbecome thinner, not only the nitride removal rate but alsothe numbers of micro-scratches and defects should be\ncontrolled more strictly to improve the device character-\nistics. To improve the selectivity, ceria slurries with anionicsurfactants have been used.\n3,4,8,11)The anionic surfactant is\nadsorbed onto the nitride \ufb01lm and acts as a passivation layer,thereby the nitride removal rate is decreased.\n13,14,17)\nNot only the surfactant characteristics but also the\nabrasive characteristics are critical issues for STI-CMP ceriaslurries. Generally, the \ufb01lm removal rate and the number of\nsurface defects decrease as the abrasive size is reduced,\nbecause the mechanical force between the pressed pad andthe abrasive particles is weakened.\n14)While STI-CMP with\nsmaller abrasive particles leads to a lower number of surfacedefects, it also leads to other unpredictable e\ufb00ects, such asan increase in the nitride removal rate caused by extrasurfactant consumption due to the higher speci\ufb01c surfacearea of the small particles in the slurry.\n17)Therefore, during\nthe synthesis of the ceria slurry, controlling small particles\nand obtaining a narrow particle size distribution areimportant factors a\ufb00ecting the oxide-to-nitride removalselectivity. The calcination process is widely used to controlthe physical characteristics of ceria particles in slurry,including the speci\ufb01c surface area, density, and crystallin-ity,\n11)which greatly a\ufb00ects STI-CMP performance. Specif-\nically, the e\ufb00ect of the two-step calcination reported by our\ngroup shows the ability to control the slurry characteristicsby calcination.17)Abrasive particles calcined by two-step\ncalcination are harder and denser, and have a narrowerdistribution of primary grain size, without large grains thatcause microscratches and small primary grains that triggerthe agglomeration of colloidal particles, even though theparticles have the same grain and secondary particle sizes as\nthese in slurry calcined by one-step calcination. Using these\nparticles, we can improve STI-CMP performance, namely,higher oxide removal rate, higher oxide-to-nitride selectiv-ity, and fewer defects. Moreover, the milling process is usedto disperse agglomerates and aggregates and to control theparticle size distribution and the shapes of the abrasiveparticles.\n5,6)In particular, the size of the beads used for\nmilling is very important for obtaining abrasive particles in\nthe submicron size range. The applied energy intensity and\nthe rate of stress application in the milling machine alsoa\ufb00ect the particle size and size distribution.\n18,19)\nIn this study, we investigated the e\ufb00ects of the calcination\ntemperature to study the characteristics of two-step calcina-tion when we manufacture a ceria abrasive from STI-CMPslurry. Moreover, to control the proportions of large and \ufb01neparticles, which cause microscratches by agglomeration, we\ninvestigated the e\ufb00ects of bead size during the milling\nprocess after two-step calcination. In addition, we evaluatedSTI-CMP performance using these slurries.\n2. Experimental Procedure\nIn this study, three types of ceria particles were synthe-\nsized from a starting material of high-purity ceriumcarbonate using the solid-state displacement reaction meth-\nod. One type of ceria powder was calcined using the one-\nstep calcination method, whereas the other samples werecalcined using a two-step calcination method. In the case ofone-step calcination, the carbonate precursor was calcinedonly once at 730\n/C14C for 4 h. In the case of two-step\ncalcination, the ceria particles were obtained through anadditional calcination at 550 or 580\n/C14C for 4 h, after initial\ncalcination at 650 or 680/C14C, respectively, for 4 h. In\naddition, between the \ufb01rst and second calcination steps,\nthe ceria particles were crushed with a dry mechanicalcrusher called an air jet mill. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the\n/C3E-mail address: parkjgL@hanyang.ac.krJapanese Journal of Applied Physics\nVol. 46, No. 12, 2007, pp. 7671\u20137677\n#2007 The Japan Society of Applied Physics\n7671\nceria particles calcined at 680/C14C for 4 h before and after the\ncrushing, respectively. To summarize, the powders calcinedin two steps were calcined for a longer period of time and at\na lower temperature than those calcined in the conventional\nmanner. In previous studies, we simply explained that thetwo-step calcination method, in which ceria abrasiveparticles have an advantage during calcination showinghigh density and low porosity without abnormal graingrowth in manufacturing process of the ceria slurry.\n17)In this\ninvestigation, however, we focused on not only the two-stepcalcination process but also the media size during milling\nprocess in ceria slurry manufacturing. In addition, we have\ncon\ufb01rmed the di\ufb00erence in calcination temperature toimprove the remaining particles and the nitride \ufb01lm losswhile a reasonable oxide removal rate is maintained afterCMP. A detailed discussion is provided below.\nAfter the calcination and dry crushing of each powder, the\ntwo-step powder calcined at 680 and 580\n/C14C was further\ncrushed by wet mechanical bead milling with di\ufb00erent bead\nsizes of 0.8, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 mm, made of ZrO 2, for 3 to 5 h\nto reduce its secondary particle size to the target size rangeof 250\u2013300 nm. In contrast, the other two-step powder(calcined at 650 and 550\n/C14C) and the one-step powder were\nmilled using only 0.3 mm beads. The ceria abrasives werethen dispersed in deionized water and stabilized by adding100 ppm of a commercially available dispersant [poly-(methacrylate acid)]. The solid content was controlled at\n5 wt % of ceria powder in the ceria suspension. We also\noptionally added an anionic organic surfactant [poly(acry-lic acid)] at di\ufb00erent concentrations of up to 0.8 wt %. Thissurfactant is generally used to control the oxide-to-nitride\nselectivity with regard to removal rates. Each slurry\u2019s pHwas adjusted to the range of 6.5\u20137.5 by adding an alkalineagent. Table I shows a list of the slurry speci\ufb01cations,including the slurry pH values, abrasive sizes, and theexperimental conditions used during slurry synthesis.\nThe median size of the secondary particles in each slurry\nwas measured by using a Horiba LA910.\n10)We obtained\nimages of the ceria particles and measured the primaryparticle sizes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),using a JEOL JEM-2010. The speci\ufb01c surface areas of thepowders were estimated through Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller(BET) method, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010. Thepowder densities were measured with a pyconometer,\nnamely, an Micromeritics Accupyc 1330, after the samples\nwere outgassed at 250\n/C14C for 2 h using nitrogen gas to\nremove physisorbed species from the powder surface.\nTo investigate the e\ufb00ect the calcination process on STI-\nCMP performance, CMP evaluation tests were carried outwith commercial 8\n00wafers covered with plasma-enhanced\ntetraethylorthosilicate (PETEOS) or low-pressure chemical-vapor deposition (LPCVD) nitride \ufb01lms. The thicknesses of\nthe as-deposited oxide and nitride \ufb01lms were 7000 and\n1500 A \u02da, respectively. We polished the \ufb01lms on a Strasbaugh\n6EC and carried out ex situ conditioning with a diamond\ndresser before each polishing. We used a Rodel IC1000/Suba IV stacked pad. The polishing pressure, applied as adown force, was 4 psi, equivalent to 27.5 kPa. The relativevelocity between the pad and the wafers was 0.539 m/s. Thepolishing times were 30 s for the oxide \ufb01lms and 90 s for the\nnitride \ufb01lms. We measured the oxide and nitride thickness\nvariations of the wafers before and after CMP with aNanometrics NanoSpec 180. The variations in the locationand number of light point defects (LPDs) were measuredusing the stationary beam technology and optional bright\ufb01eld channel of a KLA-Tencor Surfscan SP1. The minimumdetection size for LPDs was adjusted to 0.189\nmm.\n3. Results and Discussion\nFigure 2 shows the correlation between the median size\n(d50) of the secondary particles and the milling time with\nvarious bead sizes for the two-step powder calcined at 680and 580\n/C14C, after dispersion in deionized water. The median\nsize was markedly reduced as the milling time increased. Inaddition, the smaller bead sizes required signi\ufb01cantly shortermilling times than did the largest bead size of 0.8 mm.\nDuring the milling process, the secondary particle size is\nreduced by collision between milling bead and abrasiveparticle. In addition, the shape and size of fractured particle\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1.

Inparticular, the probability of fracture is higher when thefrequency of collisions is higher. We assume that if the otherparameters except of the bead size are \ufb01xed, then the\ncollision frequency per unit volume in the milling machine\nincreases rapidly, as the media size decreases and the mediavelocity increases.\n5)Coarser media have a large spacing with\nrespect to the slurry powder. Thus the collision frequencyand contact probability between the beads and the secondaryabrasive particles are much lower than those with \ufb01nermedia; accordingly, the secondary particle size is reducedslowly. On the other hand, smaller media have a small\nspacing with respect to the powder; thus the collision\nfrequency and the probability of fracture are higher, and thesecondary particle size is reduced more rapidly. Therefore,as shown by our results, by increasing the milling time, themedian size of the secondary abrasives was graduallydecreased to within the target range of 250\u2013300 nm evenwith the largest bead size.\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of the primary grain size\nfor the ceria abrasives calcined at 680 and 580\n/C14C, without\nsurfactant addition. The grain sizes were analyzed statisti-cally (30 grains for each set of conditions), and the averagevalues were calculated for various bead sizes. Although the\nsecondary abrasive size was \ufb01xed in the target range of\n250\u2013300 nm, the primary grain size became smaller and had\na narrower distribution as the bead size increased. Never-theless, because the coarsest beads (0.8 mm) have a largerspacing with respect to the powder, the milling timeincreased as the secondary particle size was slowly reduced,whereas with the smaller bead sizes, the abrasive size wasmarkedly reduced by the beads, which have a smallerspacing with respect to the powder. The beads must not be\ntoo small, however, because they must impart su\ufb03cient\nmechanical energy to the particles to cause fracture. In beadmilling, for a given volume, the number of balls increasesinversely with the cube of the bead radius.\n21)The milling\nrate depends on the number of contact points between theballs and the powder, which in turn depends on the speci\ufb01csurface area of the balls. As shown in Fig. 3, many \ufb01neparticles (smaller than 10 nm) were produced after milling\nwith the 0.8 and 0.4 mm beads, had small speci\ufb01c surface\nareas and aggregated around larger particles in order toreduce the total surface energy, thus promoting agglomer-ation. Such agglomeration reduces the surface potentialand stabilizes the slurry system. Hence, \ufb01ne particles canexcessively consume the anionic dispersant and surfactantfrom the bulk suspension, causing the adsorbed polymerlayer on the nitride \ufb01lm to be insu\ufb03ciently formed.\nTherefore, in slurry manufacturing, \ufb01ne particle control is\na very important consideration in size reduction induced bybead size control.\nVarinot et al. previously reported that three milling\nmechanisms in a stirred bead mill produce di\ufb00erent phasesin the resulting particle distribution, as shown schematicallyin Fig. 4.\n18)They explained that if the size of the grinding\nbeads is increased or the solid concentration is increased,\nthen fracture becomes dominant with respect to abrasion.18)\nThen, under the same conditions, if the applied energy and\nthe rate of stress are constant, the milling mechanism isdetermined by the hardness of the particles in the slurrysuspension. When the particle hardness is high, the localsurface stress is relatively lower than that needed tofragment the particle. Abrasion then becomes the dominantmechanism; thus the particles are not fractured but only\nmilled at their edges. None of these di\ufb00erent mechanisms\noccur alone, however, they are always found in combinationwith one another.\nHence, we consider that the e\ufb00ects of the bead size and\nthe milling time on the size distribution of the secondaryabrasive particles are probably directly related. Therefore,the size distribution may be strongly a\ufb00ected by the millingmechanism. In this study, in the case of the slurry milled\nwith 0.2 mm beads, the average particle distribution was\nshifted to a large size as compared with the slurries milledwith larger beads, even though the milling time was shorter.On the other hand, the primary grain particles of the slurrymilled with 0.3 mm beads were larger than those in the otherslurries, because cleavage was the dominant mechanismreducing the particle size. Both the \ufb01ne and coarse particlesin the slurry were reduced more in size using optimally sized\n0.3 mm beads and an appropriate milling time.\nWe previously reported the physical characteristics of\nceria particles with respect to calcination temperature.\n11)Astarget size\n(250~300 nm)\n00\n5 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 04 55 0200300400500600700800900median size [nm]0.8 mm bead\n0.4 mm bead\n0.3 mm bead\n0.2 mm bead\nmilling time [h]\nFig. 2.

K IMet al.\n7673\nthe calcination temperature increases, the crystallinity and\ngrain size of ceria particles increase, because of grain growth\nduring calcination as atomic di\ufb00usion causes the wetting of\nthe grain boundaries of adjacent grains. These results explainnot only the increase in the particle density but also theincreasing hardness of the particles. Figure 5 shows high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of abrasive particlesmilled with 0.3 mm beads after calcination using each of thethree processes. As these images indicate, the ceria abrasiveshad a well-de\ufb01ned morphology and the average size of the\nprimary grains composing the abrasives, as measured from\nthe TEM images, ranged approximately from 30\u201350 nm. Asshown by these images, the primary grains of the ceriaabrasives calcined at 650 and 550\n/C14C (a) and 680 and 580/C14C\n(b) were smaller than those of the abrasives calcined onlyat 730\n/C14C (c). Kosynkin et al. previously reported that the\noxidation reaction of the cerium carbonate precursor tosynthesis the ceria particles, consisting of decarbonation and\ncrystal growth, is not always completed at a speci\ufb01c\ntemperature and that both the decarbonation and crystalgrowth are more e\ufb03cient in di\ufb00erent temperature ranges.\n20)\nIn fact, at a lower calcination temperature, the e\ufb03ciency ofthe decarbonation of cerium carbonate is high, while thecrystal growth rate is low. At a higher temperature, however,the relationship is reversed i.e., slow decarbonation andrapid crystal growth. Therefore, during calcination at a low\ntemperature, the density increases rapidly while the grain\nsize increases slowly, since most of the energy is used notfor crystal growth but for decarbonation. Thus, by control-ling decarbonation and crystal growth, it is possible to obtaindense, hard, uniform-sized particles, with uniform-sizedprimary grains. During calcination at a high temperature of730\n/C14C in the one-step process, on the other hand, the\nprimary grain size increases rapidly, since the grains\ncombine with each other to stabilize themselves by reducing\nthe total surface energy. As a consequence, the one-stepslurry had primary grains larger than 100 nm, which werelarger than those of the two-step calcined slurries. However,its density was lower, because the core of the large primarygrains reacts more slowly than the outer part of the particlesand thus cannot be calcined completely.\nAdditionally, in case of the ceria abrasives calcined at\n680 and 580\n/C14C had the lowest number of primary grains\nconsisting of \ufb01ne particles less than 10 nm in size. By thetwo-step calcination, it would be possible to generate dense\n(c)(b)(a)\nFig. 5.

Furthermore, with the ceria abrasives calcinedat 730\n/C14C, it is more produced the large secondary particle by\nagglomeration of many number of \ufb01ne primary grains lessthan 10 nm by calcinations process with high temperature. Itis thought that two-step calcined abrasive particle, which\nwas calcined at a low temperature, had less large grains than\none-step calcined abrasive. Hence, the \ufb01ne particles pro-duced by collision between milling beads and abrasiveparticle during milling process, which was made the broaderdistribution of particle size.\nFigure 6 shows the distribution of the primary grain sizes\nof the ceria abrasives for all three slurries after milling with0.3 mm beads, before dispersant addition. The primary grain\nsize of the ceria particles is reduced through the mechanical\nmilling process, although initially all the particles are thesame size. The primary grain size had a slightly broaderdistribution for the one-step slurry, and the proportion oflarge particles was also higher than that for the two-stepslurries. Hence, we concluded that the crystallinity of theone-step sample was higher than that of the other samples;the particles in this case were broken through edge grinding\nduring the milling process caused by the abrasion mecha-\nnism explained above. Regarding the primary grain size ofthe two-step slurry calcined at low temperatures (650 and550\n/C14C), however, the primary particles have a lower\ncrystallinity and are easily broken by the dominant fracturemechanism, because these particles have a lower hardnessthan those calcined at higher temperatures. On the otherhand, for the medium-sized abrasives calcined at 680 and\n580\n/C14C, the cleavage mechanism is dominant, because of the\nappropriate surface stress and mechanical force between themilling media and the abrasive polycrystalline ceria par-ticles. Therefore, the ceria abrasive calcined at 680 and580\n/C14C has fewer \ufb01ne particles smaller than 10 nm in size.\nBy controlling the calcination temperature and the bead sizeof the milling process, we can obtain ceria particles havingfewer \ufb01ne particles smaller than 10 nm in size.\nIn STI-CMP, the removal rates of the oxide and nitride\n\ufb01lms, the selectivity, uniformity, and LPD formation aregenerally a\ufb00ected by several factors, including the abrasivemorphology, grain size, secondary particle size, and particle\nsize distribution. We previously reported the e\ufb00ects ofagglomerated particles on LPD formation, removal rate,\nand removal selectivity.\n8,9)As the number of agglomerated\nparticles increases, the number of LPDs increases.

The oxide removal rate usuallydepends on the primary grain size, as shown in Fig. 6. As thegrain size increases, the oxide removal rate also increases,whereas the nitride removal rate remains almost the constantwhen the concentration of the additive is above a criticalvalue.\n13\u201315)We previously reported a removal mechanism\nfor an oxide \ufb01lm with a ceria slurry.12)In this mechanism,\nthe kinematical energy of the abrasives is the dominant\nfactor in oxide polishing; that is, the abrasive size, polishingpressure, relative velocity between the table and the head,and other factors a\ufb00ect the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm.\n12,14)\nThe nitride removal rate of the slurry calcined in one-stepprocess was lower than that of the other samples, and thetwo-step slurry showed a slightly higher nitride removalrate; speci\ufb01cally the slurry calcined at 650 and 550\n/C14C\nshowed the highest removal rate. We previously reported the\nrelationship between the molecular weight of PAA and theoxide-to-nitride selectivity in STI-CMP.\n22)PAA is adsorbed\non both the oxide and nitride \ufb01lms, but it is more stronglyadsorbed onto the nitride \ufb01lm; thus, a denser passivationlayer is formed as the molecular weight of PAA increases.That is the nitride removal rate was a\ufb00ected by the amountof PAA adsorbed onto \ufb01lm. The result of nitride removal\nrate can be explained by this mechanism. As shown in\nFig. 8, which is discussed below in detail, with an increasein calcination temperature, the surface area of the slurrydecreases. Moreover, with an increase in surface area, theparticles consume more PAA molecules. Thus, the particlescan excessively consume the surfactant from the bulksuspension, causing the adsorbed polymer layer on thenitride \ufb01lm to be insu\ufb03ciently formed.\n16)Consequently, the\nnitride removal rate increases with the proportion of surface\narea, resulting in poor oxide-to-nitride removal selectivity.Therefore, as the calcination temperature increases, theremoval selectivity increases. The number of LPDs, how-ever, increased drastically for the slurry calcined at 730\n/C14C,\nas shown in Fig. 7(c). As noted above, we previouslyreported the e\ufb00ects of agglomerated particles on the removalrates of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms.\n9)These agglomerated\nparticles cause many LPDs after polishing.8)In this study,\nthe slurry calcined at 730/C14C had not only more agglom-\nerated particles but also more primary grains larger than100 nm in size, as shown in Fig. 5(c). It is consider that these\nagglomerated particles and large grains cause the formation\nof many LPDs. As discussed above, with an increase in\ncalcination temperature, the oxide-to-nitride removal selec-tivity increases, and the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lmdecreases, however, the number of LPDs increases.\nFigure 8 shows the speci\ufb01c surface area and the density of\nthe slurry particles after drying the synthesized powder. Thedensities of the two-step samples were higher than that of theone-step sample, and speci\ufb01c surface area showed the same\ntendency. This means that the ceria particles of the two-step\nsamples were denser and harder (less porous), because ofthe higher degree of synthesis, than those of the one-stepsample. However, in our experiment, the oxide removal ratewas a\ufb00ected more by primary grain size than by hardness ofthe particles, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7(a). Moreover, thenitride removal rates were di\ufb00erent, that the selectivity forthe one-step sample was better than that for the two-step\nsamples. As noted above, however, it is considered that the\nagglomerated particles and large grains cause the formationof many LPDs. Therefore, to improve the STI-CMPperformance, ceria slurries with large proportions of both\ufb01ne and agglomerated large particles should be carefullycontrolled using an optimum bead size during milling.\n4. Conclusions\nWe investigated the e\ufb00ects of calcination and milling\nprocess conditions during ceria slurry synthesis on \ufb01lmremoval and the formation of LPDs. During a continuousmechanical milling process after calcination, \ufb01ne particleswere formed with a longer milling time using coarser beads.The slurries with many \ufb01ne particles excessively consumedthe surfactant in the bulk suspension and formed agglom-erates because of the particles\u2019 large speci\ufb01c surface area. In\nour experiments, we found that the optimum bead size was\n0.3 mm with a two-step process of calcination at 680 and580\n/C14C. This approach generated a appropriate particle\ndistribution in the ceria slurry, with lower levels of \ufb01neprimary grains and large agglomerated particles, becauseduring the milling process, the abrasive particles werebroken predominantly through a cleavage mechanism.Hence, the nitride removal rate was di\ufb00erent value in this\ncase, meaning better selectivity with a larger primary grain\nsize and more agglomerated particles for slurries calcinedin one step than for slurries calcined in two steps. Theagglomerated particles and large grains, however, causedthe formation of many LPDs. Therefore, to improve STI-CMP performance, ceria slurries with large proportions ofboth \ufb01ne and agglomerated large particles should becarefully controlled by using an optimum bead size during\nmilling.\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was supported by the Korea Ministry of\nScience and Technology through the National ResearchLaboratory (NRL) program.

Signi \ufb01cant fusion occurred between the primary nanocrystals and the\nsurface of the octahedrons became smooth at the calcination temperature of 800/C14C. Single crystal\nCeO 2octahedrons were formed when the calcination temperature reached 900/C14C. The change in\nmicrostructure induced by elevated calcination temperature led to increased mechanical hardness anddecreased surface chemical activity (speci \ufb01c surface area and surface Ce\n3+concentration) of the\noctahedrons, which had an impact on their polishing performance. The polishing experiments on K9glass showed that the polishing rate \ufb01rst increased and then decreased with the increment of calcination\ntemperature, indicating that in addition to the mechanical hardness, the surface chemical activity of the\noctahedrons is also important for material removal. Owing to the best matching of chemical activity and\nmechanical hardness, CeO\n2octahedrons calcinated at 700/C14C exhibited the highest polishing rate and\nthe best surface quality for K9 glass.\nIntroduction\nCeria is an important rare earth functional material that is\nwidely used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors,catalysts, ultraviolet absorbents, biological \ue103elds and polishing\nmaterials.\n1\u20137As a polishing material, ceria has many advan-\ntages, such as high polishing rate, little damage to the polishedsurface, good surface quality a \ue09der polishing and high removal\nselectivity, and therefore, has been used as the key abrasive forthe chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of optical glass,\nadvanced integrated circuits and dielectric layers deposited for\nthe fabrication of microelectronic devices.\n6\u20138In recent years,\nwith the decrease in size of the integrated circuit architecturedue to chip miniaturization and the increase in precision of theoptical glass planarization due to device upgrade, higherrequirements are put forward for ceria abrasives.\n9\u201313\nA number of studies have been carried out with respect to the\nsynthesis and tailoring of ceria abrasives, in which the physical\nand chemical characteristics of ceria particles, such as\nmorphology, size, surface state, have a great in \ue104uence on thepolishing performance.14\u201318Huet al. compared the polishing\nperformance of CeO 2nano-octahedrons and nanospheres on\nthe silicon single crystal substrate and the results showed thatthe CeO\n2nano-octahedrons with exposed {111} facets exhibited\na stronger material removal capacity and inferior polishingquality than spheres-shaped CeO\n2because the nano-\noctahedron with sharp corners and well-de \ue103ned edges could\ninduce higher compressive stress.19Sreeremya et al. observed\na strong morphology dependence of ceria nano-abrasives inglass polishing and the ceria nanostructure with a mixedmorphology of rods and cubes exhibited the highest materialremoval rate and the best surface \ue103nish compared to nano-cube\nand nanosphere.\n20Peng et al. carried out contrast experiments\nusing ceria abrasive with micro and nano particle sizes in glass\npolishing and found that the material was removed by chemical\nreaction for ceria nanoparticles, while chemical reaction andmechanical abrasion simultaneously took place for ceria parti-cles with sizes at scale of micrometers.\n21\nIn addition to size and morphology of the particle, the pol-\nishing performance of ceria abrasive is also a \ufb00ected by the heat\ntreatment conditions. Janos et al. prepared ceria abrasive by\ncalcining carbonate or oxalate precursors and the calcination\ntemperature was found to be a critical parameter that governed\nthe polishing e \ufb03ciency and the quality of the polished\nsurface.22Kim et al. studied the e \ufb00ect of the oxygen partial\npressure on the crystalline structure of ceria particles during theaSchool of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang,\nJiangxi 330031, China.

Herein, using hierarchicalCeO\n2octahedrons as precursor, we synthesized a series of octa-\nhedral ceria abrasives with di \ufb00erent microstructure and surface\ncharacteristics by varying calcination temperature. The relation-ship between calcination temperature and microstructure,mechanical hardness and chemical activity was establishedthrough polishing experiments on K9 glass. This work shed a lighton manipulating the mechanical and chemical properties of ceriaabrasives from a microstructural perspective, providing new ideasfor the design and synthesis of ceria polishing materials.\nExperimental\nPreparation\nHierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor with an average edge\nlength of /C24200 nm was synthesized according to our previous\nreport by a hydrothermal method.24Typically, 21.711 g of\nCe(NO 3)3$6H2O and 11.117 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30)\nwere dissolved in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water. The pH of thesolution was adjusted to 4.0 with 0.1 M NaOH solution. Themixture was transferred into a Te \ue104on-lined stainless autoclave\n(capacity 500 ml) and heated at 180\n/C14C for 24 h. A \ue09der washed\nand dried in an oven at 60/C14C for 12 h, the hierarchical CeO 2\noctahedrons were calcined at 500, 600, 700, 800 or 900/C14C in air\nfor 2 h to obtain polishing abrasive (Sample A \u2013E).\nCharacterization\nThermal analysis was performed using a PE PYRIS Diamond TG-\nDTA in air at a heating rate of 10/C14Cm i n/C01from room tempera-\nture to 900/C14C. The phase and composition of the samples were\ncharacterized by X-ray powder di \ufb00raction (XRD, Bruker axs D8\nAdvance) using Cu K aradiation ( l\u00bc0.15406 nm). The\nmorphology and structure were examined by \ue103eld-emission\nscanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Quanta-200F micro-scope) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 microscope). Raman spectra were recorded on a RenishawinVia spectrometer using 532 nm laser excitation. The BET (Bru-nauer \u2013Emmett \u2013Teller) surface area of the samples was deter-\nmined by physical adsorption of N\n2at 77 K using a Quantachrome\nAutosorb-iQ gas adsorption analyzer. The surface zeta potential\nmeasurement of the samples was performed using an AgilentZetaprobe 7020. The particle size distribution was measured bya Bettersize 2000LD particle size analyzer. X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using a Thermo Scienti \ue103c\nEscalab 250Xi with Al K aradiation ( hn\u00bc1486.6 eV).\nPolishing tests\nThe slurry was prepared by dispersing ceria abrasive calcined at\ndi\ufb00erent temperature into DI water under stirring and thentreated by ultrasound for 15 min. The solid content (for abra-\nsive) of the slurry was 3 wt% and the pH value of the slurry was\nabout 6.7. Polishing tests were performed at the K9 optical glasswafers with a diameter of 60 mm by a UNIPOL-802 CMPequipment (Shenyang Kejing Co. Ltd.). The polishing processparameters were set as follows: using a synthetic leather padwith rotation speed 200 rpm, downforce 0.67 psi, feed rate of theslurry 2 L min\n/C01, polishing temperature of 25 /C62/C14C, polishing\ntime 1 h. A \ue09der polishing, the wafers were rinsed by absolute\nethyl alcohol and DI water and then dried naturally in a super\nclean room. Material removal rate (MRR) was calculatedaccording the formula MRR \u00bc(m\n0/C0m)/rtA, where ris the\ndensity of the K9 glass (2.51 g cm/C03),Ais the area of the wafer, t\nis polishing time, m0is the original mass of the wafer and mis\nmass of the wafer a \ue09der polishing. The MRR is the average of 3\nruns. The surface topography and root mean square (RMS)roughness were measured by atomic force microscope (AFM,\nBruker Dimension Icon).\nResults and discussion\nThe hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor was self-assembled\nby spherical primary nanocrystals of about 5 nm which sharedan almost common crystallographic orientation (Fig. S1 \u2020). The\nthermal behaviour of the precursor was investigated with TG-DTA. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the TG curve exhibited contin-uous weight loss in a broad temperature range from roomtemperature to 500\n/C14C. The total weight loss is measured at\nabout 13%. The weight loss before 200/C14C is ascribed to the\nremoval of free water or adsorbed water and the signi \ue103cant\nweight loss from 200 to 500/C14C is attributed to the combustion\nof the residual surfactant PVP. The DTA curve showed twoexothermic peaks around 254 and 337\n/C14C, corresponding to the\nexothermic behaviour during the thermal decomposition/oxidation of PVP.\nFig. 2 showed the XRD patterns of the calcined products. All\nthe di\ufb00raction peaks can be indexed to the pure cubic \ue104uorite\nstructure of CeO\n2with lattice constant of a\u00bc5.41 \u02daA, which is in\ngood agreement with the JCPDS card (no. 34-0394). As thecalcination temperature was increased, the peaks in the XRDpattern became sharper and the full width at half maximum\nFig. 1 TG-DTA pattern of the hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As illustrated in Fig. 3a \u2013e, the samples calcined at\ndi\ufb00erent temperatures have octahedral shape with rounded\nedges and corners. High-magni \ue103cation SEM images of a single\noctahedron revealed that they possessed di \ufb00erent surface\nstructures (Fig. 3f \u2013j). The samples calcined at temperature\nvalues of 500, 600 and 700/C14C have a hierarchical structure\nsimilar to the precursor and small primary particles can be\nclearly observed on the surface. When the calcination temper-\nature increased to 800 and 900/C14C, the surface of the calcined\nproducts became smooth, indicating that the primary particleswere fused.\nMore details about the crystallinity and structure of the\nsamples calcined at di \ufb00erent temperatures were studied with\nTEM, selected area electron di \ufb00raction (SAED) and high-\nresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).\nFig. 4a \u2013c displayed the typical TEM images of a single particle of\nSample A \u2013C oriented along the [110] zone axis, showing that\nthey were assembled from small primary particles. The corre-sponding SAED patterns exhibited single-crystal-like electrondi\ufb00raction spots, in which the high-order di \ufb00raction spots were\nobviously prolonged (Fig. 4f \u2013h). This suggested that the primary\nparticles were assembled into octahedrons with almost thesame crystallographic orientation. As the calcination tempera-ture was increased to 800\n/C14C, the primary particles fused\nsigni\ue103cantly and the elongation of high-order di \ufb00raction spots\nbecame inconspicuous (Fig. 4d and i). When the calcinationtemperature reached 900\n/C14C, CeO 2octahedrons with single\ncrystal structure were obtained (Fig. 4e and j). The HRTEM\nimages (Fig. 4k \u2013o) taken from the white-boxed areas in Fig. 4a \u2013e\nrevealed the evolution of primary particles with the incrementof calcination temperature. The primary nanocrystals changedfrom spherical-like particles of about 5 nm to sharp octahedralparticles with the edge length of about 8 nm as the calcinationtemperature increased from 500 to 700\n/C14C. With the calcination\ntemperature rising up to 800/C14C, the primary nanocrystals were\nfused together to form big particles and the boundary between\nthese big particles was not obvious. As the calcination temper-\nature was 900/C14C, the primary nanocrystals were completely\nfused and the hierarchical structure disappeared, formingsingle crystal CeO\n2octahedrons. This is consistent with the XRD\nresults, i.e., the increase in calcination temperature led to the\nincrease of crystallinity and grain size.\nThe Raman spectroscopy technology was also used to\ninvestigate the structure of the calcined products. As shown in\nFig. 5, the main Raman band was peaked at about 462.5, 462.6,\n464.2, 464.7, 465.9 cm/C01for Sample A \u2013E. It belongs to the only\nallowed Raman mode (F 2g) of cubic- \ue104uorite-structured CeO 2,\nwhich is attributed to the symmetrical stretching mode of Ce \u2013\nO8vibrational unit.25The F 2gmode is very sensitive to the\ndisorder in oxygen sublattice caused by thermal or grain sizedinduced e \ufb00ects.\n26\u201328In bulk CeO 2this frequency is 465 \u2013\n466 cm/C01. For the calcined products, we observed a red-shi \ue09dof\nthis main Raman band accompanied by peak broadening as the\ncalcination temperature decreased. This is attributable to thedecrease of grain size revealed by XRD and TEM.\nThe products calcined at di \ufb00erent temperatures were\nprepared into polishing slurries to investigate their polishing\nFig. 2 XRD patterns of the calcined products (Sample A \u2013E).\nFig. 3 Low-magni \ufb01cation SEM images of Sample A \u2013E( a\u2013e) and high-magni \ufb01cation SEM images of a single particle for Sample A \u2013E( f\u2013j).\n16556 |RSC Adv. , 2022, 12,1 6 5 5 4 \u201316560 \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Table 1 showed the physical charac-\nteristics of the calcined products and their MRR values forpolishing K9 glass. It can be seen that the speci \ue103c surface area\ndecreased with values at 122.80, 113.01 and 75.96 m\n2g/C01with\nthe increasing calcination temperature at 500, 600 and 700/C14C,\nwhich is consistent with the increase in the size of primary\nnanocrystals caused by the elevated calcination temperature.Due to the fusion of primary nanocrystals, the speci \ue103c surface\narea of products calcined at 800 and 900\n/C14C decreased sharply to\n34.24 and 12.79 m2g/C01. All the calcined products were positively\ncharged with the surface zeta potential of 116.6, 79.2, 77.2, 75.0and 40.2 mV for Sample A \u2013E. A zeta potential value of 30 mV\n(positive or negative) can be taken as the arbitrary value thatjudges stability of particle dispersion, so the calcined products\nhave good dispersion stability. Considering that K9 glass has anelectronegative surface charge (negative zeta potential), oppo-site surface charge will lead to the adhesion of calcined particlesto the K9 surface by electrostatic attraction, which is helpful to\nimprove the removal rate.\n29,30The particle size distribution\nmeasurement showed that D90of the calcined products was\nremarkably increased with the rising of calcination tempera-ture, resulting in the broadening of the particle size distribution(Rvalues). This may be because with the increase of calcination\ntemperature, fusion occurred not only between primary nano-crystals, but also between octahedrons, forming particleagglomerates.\nThe polishing rate of the calcined products towards K9 glass\nwas also shown in Table 1. With calcination temperature rising,MRR \ue103rst increased and then decreased. The products calcined\nat 700\n/C14C was found to possess the highest MRR (187.9\nnm min/C01). From the mechanical e \ufb00ect during polishing, the\nincrement of calcination temperature increased the grain sizeand made the octahedrons denser, thereby improving themechanical hardness of the octahedral particles, which could\nexplain the increase in MRR from 140.6 to 187.9 nm min\n/C01\nwhen the calcination temperature went up from 500 to 700/C14C.\nHowever, as the calcination temperature continued to rise to800 and 900\n/C14C, we observed a decrease in MRR. This showed\nthat apart from the mechanical friction, the chemical e \ufb00ect\nduring polishing is also important.\nCeO 2is an excellent polishing material for glass, because it\nrelies not only on mechanical friction but also on chemical\nFig. 4 TEM images (a \u2013e) and corresponding SEAD patterns (f \u2013j) of single particle for Sample A \u2013E.

Fig. 6 showed the Ce 3d spectra ofSample A \u2013E. Quantitative calculation of the Ce\n3+concentration\nwas conducted by peak deconvolution of XPS spectra using themixed Gaussian \u2013Lorentzian function. Ten deconvoluted peaks\ncould be observed, of which the peaks labelled as vcorrespond\nto Ce 3d\n5/2at low binding energy and the peaks labelled as u\nrefer to Ce 3d 3/2at high binding energy.40Among the ten peaks,\ntwo doublets ( v0,u0), (v1,u1) are indexed to two di \ufb00erent \ue103nal\nstates of Ce3+in CeO 2owing to the emission from the spin \u2013orbit\nsplit 3d 5/2and 3d 3/2core levels and three doublets ( v0,u0), (v00,\nu00), (v000,u000) result from di \ufb00erent \ue103nal states of Ce4+. The\nconcentration of Ce3+ions in Sample A \u2013E was calculated by\ndividing the area corresponding to Ce3+to the total integrated\narea of Ce 3d. As displayed in Table 2, with increasing calcina-tion temperature from 500 to 900\n/C14C, the Ce3+concentration\ndecreased from 24.2 to 20.5%. Combined with the speci \ue103c\nsurface area data, it can be concluded that the surface chemicalactivity decreased from Sample A to Sample E.\nFig. 7 showed the O1s XPS spectra of the calcined products.\nThe peak centered at 529.0 \u2013529.6 eV is ascribed to the charac-\nteristic peak of lattice oxygen in CeO\n2. The position of this peak\nshi\ue09ded to lower binding energy with increasing calcination\ntemperature, indicating the change in the chemical environ-ment of lattice oxygen in CeO\n2. According to the reports in\nliterature,41,42the conversion of Ce3+to Ce4+in CeO 2easily led to\nthe shi \ue09dof oxygen binding energy to a low position.

The decline in chemical activity thus resulted in lower\nMRR for Sample D and E calcined at 800 and 900\n/C14C than for\nSample C calcined at 700/C14C.\nSurface quality a \ue09der polishing is also crucial to evaluate the\nCMP e \ufb00ect. Fig. 8 displayed the surface roughness of the K9\nglass wafer before and a \ue09der polished with the calcined prod-\nucts. Results showed that the RMS surface roughness of K9glass in a 20 mm/C220mm area a \ue09der CMP by Sample A \u2013E was\n1.66/C60.131, 0.893 /C60.058, 0.793 /C60.066, 0.877 /C60.072 and\n0.951 /C60.065 nm, respectively. Sample C calcinated at 700\n/C14C\nexhibited the best surface quality a \ue09der polishing. The K9\nsurface polished by Sample A has a high surface roughnessalthough the particle size distribution of this sample is narrow,which should be ascribed to the mismatch between chemicalactivity and mechanical hardness of the particles. The RMSroughness of K9 glass polished by Sample D and E alsoincreased compared to Sample C. In addition to the mismatch\nbetween chemical activity and mechanical hardness of the\nparticles, this may be also related to the broadening of particlessize distribution.\nAlthough all the calcined products have the quasi-octahedral\nshape with a similar edge length of 200 nm, their microstruc-ture and physicochemical properties changed due to thedi\ufb00erent calcination temperatures, leading to varied polishing\ne\ufb00ects. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the octahedral CeO\n2in water is\nterminated with Ce \u2013OH 2+due to the positive zeta potential\nwhile the surface of the K9 wafer is Si \u2013O/C0.43The opposite\nsurface charge between K9 surface and the calcined octahe-drons leads to a strong electrostatic attraction.

Rare earth carbonates, as precursors\nof ceria-based abrasives, directly affect the morphology of ceria-based abrasives, which, in turn,\naffects the material removal rate (MRR) and the surface roughness (R a) after polishing. Herein, rare\nearth carbonates with different morphologies were obtained by adjusting reaction parameters during\nprecipitation, including \ufb02ake, spindle, and spheroid. Moreover, the phase of precursors was analyzed,\nand the evolution process of morphology from precursors to ceria-based abrasives was investigated.\nFurthermore, the effect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was\nexplored. The results show that the primary particles of ceria-based abrasives are near-spherical, but\nthe morphology and dispersion of the secondary particles are obviously inherited from precursors.\nAmong them, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives prepared by nearly monodisperse near-spherical\nprecursors show better uniformity and higher dispersion, and they not only achieve the lowest R abut\nalso obtain a higher MRR of 555 nm/min (9 wt.%) for polishing TFT-LCD glass substrates. The result\nis signi\ufb01cant for the further optimization and application of high-performance ceria-based abrasives.\nKeywords: ceria-based abrasives; rare earth precursors; chemical mechanical polishing; TFT-LCD\nglass substrates\n1. Introduction\nCeria-based abrasives are an important CMP-polishing material, which are widely\nused in polishing glass, the substrate of materials devices, and other silica-containing\nmaterials, due to its uniform particle size, moderate hardness, high polishing ef\ufb01ciency,\nand excellent polishing quality [ 1\u20136]. It has been paid attention to glass substrate polishing\nbecause of its greater application prospects. The TFT-LCD glass substrates are used in the\nthin \ufb01lm transistor liquid crystal display, which is a key strategic material in the electronic\ninformation display industry. Their surface machining accuracy is directly related to\nthe display panel\u2019s resolution, transmittance, and other key performance indicators [ 7,8].\nThe TFT-LCD glass substrates are divided by the area in the display industry, and it is\ngenerally considered that the 6th generation line and below is the low generation, and\nthe 8.5 generation line (2200 mm \u00022500 mm) and above is the high generation. The high\ngeneration conforms to the development trend of the future large-screen and multi-screen\nera, and market demand is increasing. The high-generation TFT-LCD glass substrate is thin\nand soft, so the polishing accuracy is extremely strict. A single piece of high-generation\nglass substrate has an area of more than 5.5 m2and a thickness of only a few hundred\nmicrometers. The polished glass substrate is required to have high \ufb02atness and smoothness.\nMaterials 2022 ,15, 7525. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15217525 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022 ,15, 7525 2 of 11\nFurthermore, the requirements for the performance of ceria-based abrasives are getting\nmore stringent, including a higher MRR and an extremely low R a[9]. Ceria-based abrasives\nand polished substrates polished exhibit chemical and mechanical interactions in the\nCMP process, and mechanical interactions play a dominant role [ 10\u201312]. The morphology\nof abrasives is a very important factor in the CMP process. It can signi\ufb01cantly affect\nthe polishing performance and CMP-induced defects, such as erosion and dishing [ 13].\nTherefore, the morphology of ceria-based abrasives needs to be further optimized because\nof its signi\ufb01cant impact on polishing performance.\nCurrently, the commonly used preparation method of ceria-based abrasives mainly\nincludes three processes, which are precipitation, \ufb02uorination, and calcination [ 14\u201316].\nHowever, high-precision classi\ufb01cation is adopted to reasonably control the size of ceria-\nbased abrasives [ 17,18]. The morphology and structure of ceria-based abrasives determine\ntheir polishing performance, so the in\ufb02uence of different process parameters on ceria-\nbased abrasives has been studied extensively [ 19]. The \ufb02uorination can improve the\ndispersity of particles and the ceria-based abrasives\u2019 MRR for the glass by introducing the\n\ufb02uridizer [ 20,21]. The \ufb02uorine (F) atoms can signi\ufb01cantly improve the chemical activity\nof ceria in the polishing process, as well as enhance its polishing performance, and it\ncan form LaOF and LaF 3. However, LaF 3with low hardness is easily crushed during\npolishing, which lowers the MRR and shortens the useful life of ceria-based abrasives.\nHydro\ufb02uoric acid (HF) is widely used as a \ufb02uridizer because of its better reaction rate\nand reaction uniformity, but excessive addition can damage the polished glass surface and\nincrease the R a[22]. In addition, calcination directly impacts phase structures and surface\nproperties of ceria-based abrasives [ 19,23,24]. It was found for the ceria-based abrasives\nthat the MRR increases with the calcination temperature. In the temperature range of\nca.300\u2013700\u000eC,not only do the physical characteristics of ceria-based abrasives change\ndramatically, but so do their chemical activities [ 25,26]. However, there are still relatively\nfew studies that demonstrate clear relationships of precursors, ceria-based abrasives, and\npolishing performance.\nRare earth carbonates are precipitation precursors, which are widely used in the\nindustrial production of ceria-based abrasives. Previous research has shown that there\nare many types of rare earth carbonates, including rare-earth carbonates (RE 2(CO 3)3) [27],\nhydroxycarbonates (REOHCO 3) [28], oxycarbonate hydrates (RE 2O(CO 3)2\u0001H2O), and di-\noxycarbonates (RE 2O2CO 3) (where RE represents a rare-earth ion) [ 29\u201331], which have\nbeen studied extensively at the nano- and micro-scale. In addition, rare earth carbonates\nwith a broad range of morphologies can be obtained by different synthetic methods and\nexperimental conditions, including spherical particles, triangular microplates, nanorods,\nnanoplates, etc. [ 32]. The urea homogenous precipitation method was the \ufb01rst technique\nemployed to synthesize monodispersed spherical particles of rare earth carbonates [ 33].\nNanorods and nanoplates of rare earth carbonates can be obtained by altering counter\nanions [ 34]. Rare earth carbonates as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, their phase\nstructures, and morphologies directly affect the physicochemical characteristics of abrasives\nand further affect their polishing rate and polishing precision. However, ordinary ceria-\nbased abrasives are commonly prepared by \ufb02ake-like rare earth carbonates in industrial\nproduction, which is the main reason for the low polishing accuracy.\nHere, this work focus on the effects of rare earth carbonates on the morphology and\nchemical mechanical polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives. Rare earth carbonates\nwith different phase structures and morphologies were synthesized by altering conditions\nduring precipitation, where ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4HCO 3) and lanthanum-cerium\nsulfate mixed liquid ((Ce 0.7, La 0.3)2(SO 4)3\u0001xH2O) were used as raw materials, and La\nwas added to improve the polishing performance of abrasives [ 35,36]. Then, ceria-based\nabrasives were obtained by \ufb02uorating and calcinating rare earth carbonates with different\nshapes, and the effect of precursors on the morphology of ceria-based abrasives was studied.\nFurthermore, the CMP process of ceria-based abrasives prepared by different precursors\nMaterials 2022 ,15, 7525 3 of 11\nwas evaluated, and TFT-LCD glass substrates were used as polishing workpieces. The\neffect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was investigated.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1.

Polishing Measurements\nThe polishing process of ceria-based abrasives for TFT-LCD glass substrates was\nperformed by a high-precision laboratory polishing machine (ProLap-15). Ceria-based\nabrasives were applied in the form of an abrasives slurry with different mass percentages.\nFor each experiment, TFT-LCD glass substrates with a thickness of 0.5 mm were cut to\n20 mm \u000225 mm as polishing samples, and they adhered to a ceramic disc for polishing. The\npolishing test was performed with a pressure of 95 kPa and a time of 10 min. The velocity of\nthe polishing pad was 45 rpm, and the \ufb02ow velocity of the abrasives slurry was 50 mL/min.\nAfter polishing, polishing samples were removed from the ceramic disc by heating, rinsed\nwith alcohol, and dried for further testing. The MRR of TFT-LCD glass substrates was\ndetermined via gravimetry from the mass loss during the polishing experiment, and the\nresults were expressed in terms of the linear removal rate of TFT-LCD glass substrates in\nnm/min. In addition, scratches were observed and recorded on the surface of TFT-LCD\nglass substrates by a white light interferometer.\n2.4. Characterization\nThe size and morphology of ceria-based abrasives were observed with the scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM) (SEM, JEOL, Akishima, Japan, JSM-7900F). The phase analysis\nof ceria-based abrasives was achieved by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Smart-lab, Tokyo,\nJapan, 9KW) equipped with Cu-K \u000bradiation. The scanning range was 10\u201390\u000e, and the rate\nwas 4\u000e\u0001min\u00001. The particle size distribution of ceria-based abrasives was measured by a\nlaser granularity analyzer (MS3000) after dispersing into the deionized water.

Polishing Measurements  \nThe polishing process of ceria -based abrasives for TFT -LCD glass substrates was per-\nformed by a high -precision laboratory polishing machine (ProLap -15). Ceria -based abra-\nsives were applied in the form of an abrasives slurry with different mass percentages. For \neach experiment, TFT -LCD glass substrates with a thickness of 0.5 mm were cut to 20 mm \n\u00d7 25 mm as polishing samples, and they adhered to a ceramic disc for polishing.  The pol-\nishing test was performed with a pressure of 95 kPa and a time of 10 min. The velocity of \nthe polishing pad was 45 rpm, and the flow velocity of the abrasives slurry was 50 \nmL/min. After polishing, polishing samples were removed from the ceramic di sc by heat-\ning, rinsed with alcohol, and dried for further testing. The MRR of TFT -LCD glass sub-\nstrates was determined via gravimetry from the mass loss during the polishing experi-\nment, and the results were expressed in terms of the linear removal rate of T FT-LCD glass \nsubstrates in nm/min. In addition, scratches were observed and recorded on the surface \nof TFT -LCD glass substrates by a white light interferometer.  \n2.4. Characterization  \nThe size and morphology of ceria -based abrasives were observed with the s canning \nelectron microscope (SEM) (SEM, JEOL, Akishima , Japan, JSM-7900F). The phase analysis \nof ceria -based abrasives was achieved by an X -ray diffractometer (XRD, Smart -lab, Tokyo, \nJapan, 9KW) equipped with Cu -K\u03b1 radiation. The scanning range was 10 \u00b0\u201390\u00b0, and the \nrate was 4 \u00b0\u00b7min\u22121. The particle size distribution of ceria -based abrasives was measured by \na laser granularity analyzer (MS3000) after dispersing into the deionized water. The R a \nand the polished surface state of the TFT -LCD glass substrates polished were measured \nby a white light interferometer (ZYGO NewView9000).  \n3. Results and Discussion  \nFigure 2 shows SEM images of rare earth carbonates obtained by different precipita-\ntion cond itions, which are flake -like precursors (F -precursors), spindle -like precursors (S -\nprecursors), and near -spherical precursors (N -precursors). It can be seen that F -precursors \nare made up of many irregular thin sheets stacked (Figure 2a,d). S -precursors and  N-pre-\ncursors have uniform size and morphology, where the former has an average length of \n~900 nm and a diameter of ~200 nm, and the latter has an average particle size of ~50nm. \nMoreover, N -precursors are nearly monodisperse d. The synthesis of rare earth carbonates \nwith different morphologies was achieved by controlling precipitation reaction condi-\ntions.  \n \nFigure 2. SEM images of precursors.

Figure 3\nshows the presence of amorphous phases for the N-precursors and F-precursors because of\nthe low precipitation temperature, and it can be solved by calcination.

The reaction temperature is a parameter that allows easy control\nover the size and shape of rare earth carbonate particles [ 33]. In this work, the escape\nrate of carbon dioxide from rare earth carbonates was accelerated to a certain extent by\nincreasing the reaction temperature and (Ce, La) 2O(CO 3)2\u0001xH2O were formed [ 23]. The\nphase structures of precursors with different morphologies are different.

According to crystal growth theory, the shape of the\ncrystal depends on the relative growth rate of each crystal face. In this work, it shows\nthat the morphology of precursors is affected by the relative growth rate of each crystal\nface [ 37,38], and the crystal plane of F-precursors and N-precursors with identical phases\ngrow differently, so the morphology of precursors is different.\nMaterials 2022 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5 of 11 \n \n XRD diffraction patterns of precipitation precursors in Figure 3 are shown to further \nanalyze the phase structures.

XRD diffraction patterns of different precursors.  \nFurthermore, precursors with different morphologies and phases were fluorinated \nand calcined to obtain ceria -based abrasives. Figure 4 shows SEM images of ceria -based \nabrasives, which are flake -like (F -abrasives), spindle -like (S -abrasives), and near -spherical \n(N-abrasives), respectively. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the morphology and the dis-\npersity of secondary particles about ceria -based abrasives are inherited from their precur-\nsors. Howeve r, the morphology of primary particles is almost near -spherical because of \nthe etching of the HF solution. Moreover, primary particles\u2019 sizes are close, and the aver-\nage size is ~50 nm. This result may be attributed to the consistent conditions in the fluor i-\nnation, such as the concentration and the additive amount of HF solution. Among them, \nthe size of N -abrasives does not change obviously , compared with their precursors. The \nreason is that the particle size of near -spherical precursors is small (~50 nm) an d close to \nthe primary particle size of abrasives, and it is difficult to etch into smaller particles on the \noriginal basis during fluorination. In a word, rare earth carbonates affect the morphology \nof ceria -based abrasives, and there is an apparent inher itance relationship for secondary \nparticles between them.  \nFigure 3.

In this study, the average height difference \nwithin a certain area (0.86 mm  \u00d7 0.86 mm) was calculated as  the R a. It can be seen from \nFigure 7a  that N -abrasives always achieve a lower R a than those of F -abrasives and S -\nabrasives in the concentration range of 1\u20139 wt.%. The R a of F-abrasives and S -abrasives \nare more than 1.5 nm, but the R a of N -abrasives is les s than 1 nm at the appropriate con-\ncentration. Therefore, N -abrasives\u2019 polishing quality is better because of their higher dis-\npersion and homogeneity. Figure 7b  shows the MRR of ceria -based abrasives with differ-\nent morphologies. It can be seen that the MRR of three kinds of ceria -based abrasives in-\ncreases with the increase in the slurry concentration. The MRR of F -abrasives is higher, \nand the MRR of N -abrasives is lower at the same concentration than F -abrasives. The \nshape of F -abrasives is irregular and ang ular, so the MRR is higher. By contrast, the mor-\nphology and size of N -abrasives are more uniform, so the MRR of N -abrasives is lower  \nthan F -abrasives  at the same concentration. Their MRR increases with the increase in the \nconcentration over a certain range , and the value of MRR reaches to 555 nm/min when the \nconcentration is 9 wt.%. However, the MRR of F -abrasives and S -abrasives decreases with \nthe increase in concentration from 7 wt.% to 9 wt.%. The main reason is that a higher \nconcentration is easy to cau se particle accumulation on the glass surface under experi-\nmental conditions, reducing the effective contact area [39,40 ].

Conclusions  \nPrecipitation precursors with different morphologies and phases were obtained by \naltering the reaction conditions in the precipitation. The effect of precursors on the mor-\nphology of ceria -based abrasives was explored. The result shows that the morphology and \ndispersity of secondary particles inherit their precursors, and primary particles of abra-\nsives are almost near -spherical with a size of ~50 nm because of the etching of HF solution. \nTherefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more condu-\ncive to obtaining high uniformity ceria -based abrasives.  \nFurthermore, the effect of precursors on the CMP performance of ceria -based abra-\nsives was explored. High -performance ceria -based abrasives need to achieve a high MRR \nand good polishing quality (a low R a) at the same time. Although F -abrasives have a \nhigher MRR ( \u02c3500 nm/min ), more  scratches (R a \u02c3 2 nm) are caused by their irregular mor-\nphology.

Conclusions\nPrecipitation precursors with different morphologies and phases were obtained by\naltering the reaction conditions in the precipitation. The effect of precursors on the mor-\nphology of ceria-based abrasives was explored. The result shows that the morphology\nand dispersity of secondary particles inherit their precursors, and primary particles of\nabrasives are almost near-spherical with a size of ~50 nm because of the etching of HF\nsolution. Therefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more\nconducive to obtaining high uniformity ceria-based abrasives.\nFurthermore, the effect of precursors on the CMP performance of ceria-based abrasives\nwas explored. High-performance ceria-based abrasives need to achieve a high MRR and\ngood polishing quality (a low R a) at the same time. Although F-abrasives have a higher\nMRR (>500 nm/min), more scratches (R a> 2 nm) are caused by their irregular morphology.\nBy contrast, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives are bene\ufb01cial to improving the polishing\ncontact area and reducing mechanical damage. N-abrasives obtained by N-precursors\nhave the characteristics of uniform morphology, narrow size, and high dispersion, which\nnot only achieves a high MRR (9 wt.%, 555 nm/min) but also reaches excellent polishing\nquality to TFT-LCD glass substrates, including the lower R a(<1.5 nm) and fewer scratches.\nTherefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more conducive\nto obtaining high-performance ceria-based abrasives. N-abrasives have great application\npotential for the precision polishing of TFT-LCD glass substrates.\nAuthor Contributions: Investigation, Y.Z., X.T. and Z.Z.; Software, H.H.; validation, Y.Z. and X.T.;\nformal analysis, Z.Z. and H.H.; resources, Z.F.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y .Z.; writing\u2014review\nand editing, N.W. and X.H.

[DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.43.7427]\nKEYWORDS: chemical mechanical planarization, CMP, shallow trench isolation, STI, ceria, grain size\n1. Introduction\nThe shallow trench isolation (STI) method has replaced\nthe local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) method because ofits excellent ability to decrease isolation width, leading toimproved device density.\n1)Chemical mechanical polishing\n(CMP) is applied as a key process in the STI method.\nCompared with other abrasive materials used in polishingslurry for STI CMP, cerium oxide or ceria (CeO\n2)i s\ncommonly used in ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI)processes because it provides high removal rates, due to itschemical reactivity with silica substrates, and a high removalselectivity between oxide and nitride \ufb01lms.\n2,3)The reaction\nbetween cerium oxide and glass/SiO 2\ufb01lm results in the\nformation of a chemical \u2018\u2018tooth\u2019\u2019 between the silica surface\nand the ceria particles, inducing a localized strain in theglass with particle movement.\n4)Consequently, the Si\u2013O\u2013Ce\nbonds can be rapidly removed by the mechanical forcegenerated by the pressed pad and the abrasive particles, andphysical properties, such as good crystallinity, lead to a highremoval rate for glass/SiO\n2\ufb01lm.\nThe physical properties of ceria particles in slurry can\nsigni\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ect the oxide \ufb01lm removal rate and the\npresence of CMP-induced defects, such as micro-scratchesor dishing, in the STI CMP process.\n5,6)Recently, research-\ners7\u20139)have shown interest in the physical aspects as well as\nthe chemical aspects, of the CMP mechanism. The physicalproperties of ceria particles, such as the crystallinity, particleroughness, and morphology, depend on the synthesismethod.\n9)Several methods of preparing cerium oxide have\nbeen reported in the literature: the solid-state displacement\ntechnique,10,11)wet precipitation,12)sol\u2013gel technology,13)\nthe hydrothermal technique,14)electrochemical synthesis,15)\nthe inert gas condensation technique,16)mechanochemical\nsynthesis,17)and the \ufb02ux method.18)The key parameter of\nthe physical properties a\ufb00ecting STI CMP performance,however, has not speci\ufb01cally been addressed yet. Addition-ally, the physical properties of the ceria particles a\ufb00ect the\nelectrokinetic behavior of CeO\n2particles in an aqueousmedium. The electrokinetic behavior of the abrasive\nparticles is an essential factor in the improved performanceof the slurry, since it is in\ufb02uenced by di\ufb00erences in thesurface potentials of ceria abrasives and oxide plasma-enhanced tetraethylorthosilicate (PETEOS) and CVD Si\n3N4\n\ufb01lms.2)\nIn this study, ceria particles were prepared by the solid-\nstate decomposition method, as the particles synthesized bythis technique have a higher removal rate for glass/SiO\n2\ufb01lm\nthan any of the other synthesis methods.9)Additionally, with\nthis process it is simpler and more convenient to control thephysical properties of ceria. We investigated the physicalproperties of ceria particles by controlling the calcinationtemperature in the solid-state decomposition method and\nexamining the resulting CMP performance, including the\nPETEOS removal rate in the STI CMP process. We haveattempted to correlate the physical properties of ceriaparticles, as controlled by the calcination temperature, withthe CMP performance.\n2. Experimental\nCeria powders were synthesized by the solid-state\ndecomposition method in this study. This method employs\nhigh-purity cerium carbonate [Ce(CO\n3)3, reagent grade,\nUnited International, Inc., Germany] as a starting material.The ceria powders were synthesized by calcination under anair atmosphere at various temperatures (400, 600, 700, 800,and 900\n/C14C) for 4 h, resulting in the formation of ceria\npowder. The mechanical milling of ceria powder was carriedout with a basket-type Mixer/Mill (Ring Mill, Dae Yang,\nInc., Korea) using zirconia balls (0.8 mm diameter).\nThe prepared powders were then characterized by various\nmethods. The decomposition behavior of the calcinedprecursor was monitored by simultaneous (TG and DTA)thermal analyses (SDT 2960, TA Instruments) up to 900\n/C14C\nat a heating rate of 10/C14C/min in synthetic air ( /C2420%, O 2),\nand using alumina (Alumalox, Alcoa) as a referencematerial. The crystal structure was analyzed with a di\ufb00rac-\ntometer (RINT/DMAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan) using Cu-K /C11\nradiation ( /C21\u00bc0:1542 nm) at a scan rate of 2\n/C14min/C01\n(2/C18min/C01). The intensity was logged over a 2/C18range of/C3E-mail address: upaik@hanyang.ac.krJapanese Journal of Applied Physics\nVol. 43, No. 11A, 2004, pp. 7427\u20137433#2004 The Japan Society of Applied Physics\n7427\n25\u201360/C14with a scan step of 0.02/C14. The grain sizes of the\ncalcined powders were estimated using an X-ray line\nbroadening method, by applying the Debye\u2013Scherrer equa-\ntion.19)The powder morphology was observed by trans-\nmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2010, JEOL,Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.\nAfter analyzing the prepared powders, they were dis-\npersed in deionized water. Drops of the resulting suspen-sions were put on a microscopic grid previously coveredwith a polymer and carbon \ufb01lm. Nitrogen adsorption/\ndesorption on the powder surface (Micromeritics, ASAP\n2010) was used to measure speci\ufb01c surface area (m\n2/g) and\nthe pore volume (g/cm) by applying the BET method. Toremove eventual physisorbed species from the powdersurface, the samples were outgassed at 250\n/C14C for 2 h prior\nto each analysis. The surface characteristics were determinedfrom a nitrogen adsorption isotherm measured at 77 K with aconventional volumetric apparatus.\nFor the measurement of electrokinetic behavior of ceria\nsuspension, the ceria particles were \ufb01rst dispersed indeionized water. A total of 220 ml of suspension for eachpowder was prepared at a weight fraction of 1%. Eachsuspension was subjected twice to ultrasonic treatment for15 min in order to break down agglomerates and promotemixing. An ice bath was used to control the temperature ofthe suspension during the ultrasonic treatment. To establish\nan equilibrium dispersion system, the suspension was aged\nfor 12 h at room temperature using a wrist-action shaker.Following aging, the suspension was ultrasonicated for anadditional 15 min. The electrokinetic behavior of ceriasuspensions was characterized using the electrokinetic sonicamplitude technique (ESA-9800, Matec Applied Sci., Hop-kinton, MA, U.S.A.). In ESA tests, two identical suspensionswere prepared for each analysis. Separate acid (1.0 N HCl)\nand base (1.0 N KOH) titrations were performed, beginning\nat the natural pH, and subsequently combined to generate acomplete titration curve. Based on the analysis of prelimi-nary measurement, the standard uncertainty yields /C60:1\nmPa/C1m/C1V\n/C01for ESA measurements and /C60:05(pH units)\nfor pH and IEP values, respectively. Details of this electro-acoustic technique, its application to ceramic systems, andthe estimated measurement precision, have been given in our\nprevious papers.\n20,21)\nThe CMP test was carried out using \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent types of\nslurries with di\ufb00erent calcination temperatures (400, 600,700, 800, and 900\n/C14C). The ceria abrasives were dispersed in\ndeionized water and stabilized by adding 100 ppm of acommercially available dispersant (Poly(methacylic acid),M.W. \u00bc10000 ). We also added an anionic organic surfac-\ntant (Polyacrylic acid, M.W. \u00bc50000 ) at weight fractions\n(based on solution content) of 0.5% in this experiment. Each\nslurry was diluted with deionized water to produce a \ufb01nalceria abrasive concentration of 1 wt%. Each suspension pHwas adjusted to the range of 7.0\u20138.0 by adding an alkalineagent. In CMP evaluation, a 200 mm wafer CMP tool (6EC,Strasbaugh, USA) was used. Oxide \ufb01lm was deposited bythe plasma-enhanced tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (PETEOS)method. The thickness of the as-deposited oxide \ufb01lm was\n7000 /C23A. A CMP tool for 200 mm wafers (6EC, Strasbaugh,\nUSA) was used and ex-situ conditioning with a diamond\ndresser was carried out before CMP. The polishing pad wasa grooved IC1000/Suba IV pad (Rodel, USA). The \ufb01lm\nthickness was measured with a Nanospec 180 (Nano-metrics, USA) in order to determine the removal rate. AfterCMP, the wafers were cleaned with an APM solution\n(NH\n4OH : H 2O2:H2O\u00bc1:1:1 0 )a t8 0/C14C to eliminate\nresidual particles. The polishing test conditions are listed inTable I.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe thermal analysis results of the cerium carbonate\nprecursor synthesized in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Thetotal weight loss was approximately 40%. This result was\nindicative of the representative thermal decomposition\nbehavior of the normal carbonates.\n22)The decomposition of\nthe cerium carbonate precursor had three distinct steps. The\ufb01rst step, mainly occurring at temperatures up to /C24135\n/C14C, is\ndue to the evaporation of the absorbed moisture and therelease of molecular water. The second step, occurring in therange /C24135{245\n/C14C, is due to the carbonate decomposition\nwith oxycarbonate intermediates. Complete decomposition\nis almost achieved at 300\u2013400/C14C, noting the oxidation of\nCe3\u00feto Ce4\u00feduring heating. The di\ufb00erential thermal\nanalysis curve shows two exothermic peaks. As mentionedabove, the \ufb01rst peak is due to the evaporation of the absorbedmoisture and the release of molecular water. The secondbroad exotherm is due to the carbonate decomposition withthe evolution of CO and CO\n2, and assigned to crystallization.\nSimilar results were found by other researchers.22,23)There-\nfore, we can conclude that the carbonate was fully decom-\nposed for all types of abrasive prepared in this study at acalcination temperature above 400\n/C14C.Table I.

Broadintensity peaks were observed for the ceria powders whichwere synthesized at 400\n/C14C. This result may be considered by\nthe low crystallinity with unreacted carbonate. Although theoxidation of Ce\n3\u00feto Ce4\u00feat/C24400/C14C is achieved, the grain\nsize of cerium oxide, which was calcined at this temperature,\nwas very small. This result is due to the small grains andunreacted carbonate, presented in the inner part of thecerium oxide. At the calcination temperature of 400\n/C14C, the\noxidation of the cerium carbonate is not complete. Thus thiscerium oxide is composed of cerium oxide on the surfaceand unreacted carbonate in the inner part of the particle. Thedi\ufb00raction pattern only shows the peaks of cerium oxide\nwith a \ufb02uorite structure; those for other compounds, such as\ncerium carbonate and cerous oxide, were not detected.However, the cerium oxide, which was synthesized at400\n/C14C, showed a broad intensity peak pro\ufb01le. With\nincreasing calcination temperature, the characteristic peaksof CeO\n2became sharper,24)because the grains of single\ncrystals were proportionally grown by heat treatment. Thisresult a\ufb00ected the average grain size of the particles. Thegrain size of CeO\n2was investigated to clarify the relation-\nship between the calcination temperature and the physical\ncharacteristics of the particles. The line-broadening analysisof the (111) peak in XRD was analyzed to con\ufb01rm the grainsize of particles, as will be discussed later. We con\ufb01rmedthat CeO\n2abrasive with a good crystallinity was synthesized\nafter calcination at 900/C14C.\nFigure 3 shows the TEM images and di\ufb00raction patterns\nof the particles calcined at various temperatures (400, 700,\nand 900/C14C).

The particles calcined at 400/C14C [Fig. 3(a)] showed a\nrelatively low crystallinity, whereas those calcined at 700/C14C\n[Fig. 3(b)] and 900/C14C [Fig. 3(c)] exhibited a relatively high\ncrystallinity and the shapes of the grain are well-de\ufb01ned,though some grains seem to contain subgrain boundariesinside. The ring-shaped di\ufb00raction shown in Fig. 3(a) showsthat the particles calcined at temperatures as low as 400\n/C14C\nstill maintain their crystal structure. This result coincideswith the XRD peaks shown in Fig. 2(a). The di\ufb00erencebetween the di\ufb00raction patterns of Figs. 3(b) and 2(c) is\nattributed to the number of grains in the objective aperture,\nor grain size. To investigate directly the atomic structure andcrystallinity of the ceria particle in detail,\n25)a high\u2013\nresolution TEM (HR-TEM) image and its two-dimensionalFourier-transformed image were obtained. The lattice imageof the ceria particle calcined at 400\n/C14C [Fig. 4(a)] clearly\nshows that the atomic structure of the particle has a ratherlong-range-ordering (LRO) at least longer than 5 nm. So we\ncan conclude that it is not amorphous but \ufb01ne polycrystal-\nline. A number of dislocations and orientational domainstructures are also shown. Figure 4(b) is the two-dimen-sional Fourier-transformed image of Fig. 4(a). The ring-like\npattern shown in Fig. 4(b) corresponds to the \ufb01ne poly-\ncrystalline structure with various orientations shown in\nFig. 4(a). Figure 5 shows the lattice image of the ceriaparticle calcined at 700\n/C14C (a) and its Fourier-transformed\nimage (b). The lattice image [Fig. 5(a)] shows the particlehas a highly crystalline structure, though a few dislocationsand stacking-faults were observed, which is also con\ufb01rmedfrom Fig. 5(b). The results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 coincidewell with those in Figs. 2 and 3.\nThe crystallinity of the ceria particles fabricated at various\ncalcination temperatures was also studied. The grain sizes ofthe particles were estimated using the Debye\u2013Scherrerequation\n26)by utilizing XRD line broadening as\nD\u00bc0:9/C21=\u00f0/C12cos/C18\u00de;\nwhere /C21is the wavelength of the monochromatic X-ray\nbeam, /C18is the di\ufb00raction angle, and /C12is the half-width of an\nintensity peak. The intensity peak at 2/C18\u00bc48/C14was chosen\nfor calculating the grain size, since it was clearer than anyother peak and isolated from the others.

K IMet al.\nthe grain size moderately increased overall from 14.52 to\n38.69 nm as the calcination temperature was increased from400 to 900\n/C14C, and it rapidly increased from 700 to 800/C14C,\nwhich can be attributed to thermally promoted grain\ngrowth27,28)during the calcination process. These results\nare in agreement with the trend of increasing grain size inthe TEM images shown in Fig. 3.\nThe change in the speci\ufb01c surface area of the samples,\nmeasured by the BET method,\n29)is also shown in Fig. 6. The\nparticle calcined at 400/C14C had the highest surface area of\n137 m2/g. With increasing calcination temperature, the\nsurface area continued to decrease and \ufb01nally reached a\nvalue of 1.81 m2/g at 900/C14C. The temperature dependence\nof the surface area is well correlated with the grain size, i.e.,smaller grains have larger speci\ufb01c surface areas.\n27)The\nparticle size was calculated from the speci\ufb01c surface area byassuming that all powders were spherical without intra- orinter-pores, and that the densities of all the calcined powderswere identical to that of pure cerium oxide (7.215 g/cm\n3).\nThe calculated values are listed in Table II. There was little\ndi\ufb00erence between the calculated and measured grain sizesin the cases of the particles calcined at 400 and 700\n/C14C. On\nthe other hand, there was a considerable di\ufb00erence betweenthe two methods in the case of the particles calcined at900\n/C14C, due to the occurrence of aggregation25)of the\nparticles at this temperature.\nThe total pore volume versus calcination temperature\ncurve is shown in Fig. 7. Generally, pores exist in the\nparticles as defects, which result from the decrease in theremoval rate of PETEOS \ufb01lm. This is because such pores arethe cause of decreased particle density, resulting in the\nreduction of mechanical force between the abrasive and the\ufb01lm. The pore volume markedly decreased between thecalcinations temperatures of 400\n/C14C and 600/C14C. As men-\ntioned above, the particle calcined at 400/C14C is not a dense\nparticle. Consequently many pores exist in the inner part ofthe particle. As the calcination temperature increases, the\npore volume decreases with grain growth. The reduction in\npore volume is saturated between the calcination temper-atures of 800\n/C14C and 900/C14C.\nThe surface potential of the CeO 2particles was measured\nas a function of pH by the ESA (electrokinetic sonicamplitude) technique. The electrokinetic behavior of theceria suspensions is shown in Fig. 8. The electrophoreticmobility strongly depends on the suspension pH and the\nsurface characteristics of the particle. Di\ufb00erent electro-\nkinetic behaviors were observed for the ceria powderscalcined at 400\n/C14C. The isoelectric pH (pH iep) of the particle\ncalcined at 400/C14C is 5.5, but the pH iepof CeO 2particles\ncalcined at 600 and 900/C14C is 7.5. This di\ufb00erence is due to\nthe partial oxidation of the particle at the calcinationstemperature of 400\n/C14C, resulting in di\ufb00erent surface charac-\nteristics.\nThe results of the CMP \ufb01eld evaluation are shown in\nFig. 9.

On the other\nhand, the removal rate for CVD Si 3N4\ufb01lm remainde at\n40/C23A/min at 400/C14C and 49 /C23A/min at 900/C14C, and did not vary\nmuch with calcinations temperature. Thus the oxide-to-nitride selectivity increases with calcination temperature,from 23 at 400\n/C14C to 59 at 900/C14C. The polishing of PETEOS\nis mainly a\ufb00ected by its chemical interaction with the CeO 2\nparticles, and by physical factors, including the physicalproperties of the particles, the mechanical grinding factor,and so forth.\nThe surface of PETEOS \ufb01lm is soluble in alkaline pH\nsolutions due to the dissolution of Si ions. Interactionbetween the \ufb01lm surface and the ceria particles occursduring the polishing of the PETEOS \ufb01lm, and Si\u2013O\u2013Cebonds are then formed on the \ufb01lm surface. The Si\u2013O\u2013Ce\nbonding has been reported to be the dominant mechanism in\nthe chemical interaction between PETEOS \ufb01lm and ceriaparticles.\n4)The pH was maintained constant for all slurries in\nthis experiment; thus, it can be asserted that the increase inthe removal rate of PETEOS with the calcination temper-ature is related to the physical factors rather than to thechemical interaction. These physical factors are impacted byseveral aspects of the STI CMP process, such as the CMP\nconditions, abrasive particle morphology, particle size and\ndistribution, and grain size. As seen from Fig. 3, the abrasiveparticles calcined at 400\n/C14C had di\ufb00erent morphologies as\ncompared with the other particles. The removal rate can besigni\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ected by mean particle size and agglomer-ated particle size, because frictional force is directly propor-tional to contact area.\n30)The morphology of the particles\ncalcined at 400/C14C and the slight increase in particle size\nabove a calcination temperature of 700/C14C cannot account for\nthe continued increase in removal rate with calcinationtemperature. Instead, as shown in Fig. 6, the grain sizeincreased with calcination temperature, which resulted in theincrease in the removal rate of PETEOS \ufb01lm. On the otherhand, the surface of the Si\n3N4\ufb01lm during polishing is\nthought to be passivated with adsorptive surfactant in theslurry, which prevents the abrasive from directly contacting\nthe \ufb01lm surface.\n8,31,32)Hence, the removal rates for Si 3N4\n\ufb01lm did not vary much regardless of grain size increasing\nwith calcination temperature.4. Conclusions\nWe prepared abrasive ceria particles by controlling the\ncalcination temperature (in the solid-state decompositionmethod) and conducted a CMP evaluation using theseparticles. We investigated the e\ufb00ect of increasing calcinationtemperature on the physical properties of the particles. Therelationship between the physical properties of ceria par-ticles and the removal rate of PETEOS \ufb01lm was thus\nidenti\ufb01ed. As calcination temperature increased, the crys-\ntallization degree of the particles increased and the ceriaslurry for the STI CMP process had a higher removal rate forPETEOS \ufb01lm. It can be concluded that the grain size is thekey factor accounting for the increase in the PETEOSremoval rate with the calcination temperature.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was \ufb01nancially supported by the Korea Institute\nof Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning(KISTEP) through the National Research Laboratory(NRL) Program.

Introduction\nCeria is receiving intense attention as a main slurry component for\nthe chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process in semiconductor\nmanufacturing industry due to the effective removal rate for oxide\n\ufb01lm and the softness of the particles [1,2]. Ceria-based slurry has been\nused in CMP of shallow trench isolation (STI) structures consisting of\nsilicon dioxide and silicon nitride deposition due to its high selectivity\nover nitride. For the STI-CMP process, the use of high selectivity\nslurries is very important to halt the polishing at the nitride stop layer\nand reduce the amount of defects such as erosion and dishing [3].\nDuring the past decade, structural properties, chemical aspects and\nmorphological characteristics of the ceria abrasives have been\nidenti \ufb01ed as the important parameters that in \ufb02uence the STI-CMP\nperformance [4,5]. Therefore, many approaches to control these\nproperties of ceria abrasives have been extensively investigated.\nThe commercial method for synthesis of ceria particles involves\nthermal decomposition of cerium salts such as carbonate and hy-\ndroxide [6]. This method leads to very porous ceria particles with high\nsurface area, inducing softness and high chemical reactivity to oxide\n\ufb01lms. However, the size and the shape of ceria abrasives are very\nlimited since particle growth is dif \ufb01cult to control during calcination\nprocess. To achieve the desired particle size and the uniform particle\nsize distribution, mechanical milling and \ufb01lteration is required [7].\nOther methods for preparing ceria abrasives are liquid phase pro-\ncesses [8,9]. These methods can lead to ceria abrasives with desirablemorphological characteristics by manipulating reaction parameters.\nHowever, the size of ceria abrasives is limited to less than 50 nm. Use\nof these small size particles results in low removal rates of target\nlayers during CMP.\nTo overcome these problems, \ufb02ux method is proposed to synthe-\nsize the ceria abrasives with a well-de \ufb01ned morphology. This method\nconsists of adding precursor in the required ratio to a molten salt\nmixture, which accelerates the kinetics of the formation of ceria\nparticles [10]. The ceria particles obtained by this method have the\nseveral advantages over other methods such as narrow size distribu-\ntion, desirable characteristics including very \ufb01ne size, high chemical\npurity and good chemical homogeneity [11]. However, this method\nhas seldom been applied to the synthesis of ceria abrasives for CMP\nslurry. Furthermore, the polishing performance of ceria abrasives\nsynthesized using \ufb02ux method has not been reported so far for the\nsilica and silicon nitride \ufb01lms.\nIn this work, we synthesized the ceria particles of different sizes\nwith uniform particle size distribution using the \ufb02ux method.

The\nvolume ratio of ethylene glycol to water was kept at 2:3. The reaction\nwas carried out at a temperature of 50 \u00b0C with stirring rate of 100 rpm\nfor 12 h. Air was bubbled into the precipitation reactor with passage\nthrough a gas distributor as an oxidizer. The precipitated substance\nwas separated via centrifugation and then redispersed in distilled\nwater under continuous stirring. The weight ratio of distilled water toa precipitated substance was kept 5:1. The suspension solution was\nput into an autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at\n230 \u00b0C for 6 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the precipitated\nparticles were washed with distilled water three times via centrifu-\ngation and then uniformly wetted in a potassium hydroxide/water\nmixed solution. The concentration of potassium hydroxide was 0.1 \u2013\n2.0 wt.% depending on the total weight of the precipitated particles.\nThe wetted particles were sintered for 2 h at 800 \u2013900 \u00b0C temperature.\nThe synthesized particles were washed with distilled water until the\nion conductivity of the washed solution was less than 0.5 \u03bcS. The\nschematic diagram of experimental procedure was shown in Fig. 1 .\nThe crystal structure and grain size were identi \ufb01ed through X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) using CuK \u03b1radiation. The crystallite size was esti-\nmated by the Scherrer equation according to the formula D=0.9 \u03bb/(\u03b2\ncos\u03b8), where Dis crystallite size, \u03bbis the wavelength of X-rays, \u03b2is the\nhalf-width of the diffraction peaks, and \u03b8is the diffraction angle. The\nbroadening of the re \ufb02ection from the (111) plane was used to calculate\nthe crystallite size. The morphology and sizes of the abrasive particles\nwere also examined by \ufb01eld emission scanning electron microscope\n(FESEM). The average primary particle size was calculated by\nmeasuring ca. 100 particles from FESEM micrographs. The speci \ufb01c\nsurface area (SSA) of ceria abrasives was determined by Brunauer \u2013\nEmmett \u2013Teller (BET) method using nitrogen adsorption/desorption at\n77 K.\n2.2. Polishing of wafers\nDifferent ceria-based slurries were formulated by dispersing\nabrasives each with different primary particle sizes in DI water\ncontaining an anionic organic polymer (Poly acrylic acid, PAA; Mw\n4000, LG Chem.) as dispersant. The PAA was 2 wt.% based on the total\nweight of the ceria abrasives. For each slurry, pH was adjusted to 6.5 \u20136.7\nby adding ammonium hydroxide (NH\n4OH). The solid loading of ceria\nabrasives was \ufb01xed to 2.0 wt.%. Table 1 presents the slurry character-\nistics used in polishing tests. The abrasive size distribution of slurry was\nmeasured using light scattering method (UPA 150, Microtrac Inc.). In\norder to investigate the adsorption characteristics of ceria abrasives for\nthe additive polymer, slurry A and D were dried at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. Theweight loss of the abrasives dried from slurries was measured by\nthermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was performed in an air \ufb02ow of\n100 ml/min at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min from 30 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C.\nSilicon dioxide \ufb01lm of 2 \u03bcm thick was formed on a 5-in. p-type\nsilicon substrates with (001) orientation by plasma enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The silicon nitride \ufb01lms were\ndeposited by using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD).\nPolishing tests were performed on a rotary type CMP machine (GNP\nPOLI 400, G&P technology) for 1 min with each of the ceria-based\nslurries. IC 1000/SUBA IV stacked pads (supplied by Rodel Inc.) were\nutilized as CMP pads. The downforce was 280 g/cm2and the rotation\nspeed between the pad and the wafer was 90 rpm. The slurry \ufb02ow rate\nwas 100 mL/min. The \ufb01lm thickness on the wafers before and after\nCMP was measured using spectroscopic re \ufb02ectometry (Nanospec\n6100, Nanometrics) to calculate the removal rate. In this experiment,\nthe WIWNU was de \ufb01ned as the standard deviation of remaining\nthickness divided by the average of the remaining thickness after the\nCMP process. The average polishing data for removal rate was carried\nby performing the same tests more than three times in order to\nsupport the validity of the results from the statistical viewpoint.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Morphological characteristics of ceria abrasives\nFig. 2 shows the FESEM images of abrasive particles prepared in\ndifferent calcination conditions as described in Table 1 . The primary\nparticle sizes determined using the FESEM micrographs were 84, 166,\n295, and 417 nm for slurry A, B, C and D, respectively. As shown in\nFig. 2 , the ceria particles consisted of crystalline grains with a well-\nde\ufb01ned morphology. The size of ceria particles increased with the\nincrease in concentration of potassium hydroxide and the calcination\ntemperature. These images indicate that the primary particle size can\nbe controlled by changing the calcination conditions, which in \ufb02uence\nthe crystal growth of ceria particles.\nFig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared\nparticles. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the characteristic peaks correspond-\ning to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes are located at\n2\u03b8=28.51, 33.06, 47.48, 56.20, and 59.05o, respectively. They show\nvery close to the ones with cubic \ufb02uorite structure of ceria crystal in\nJCPDS database. The sharp intensity peaks were observed for ceria\nabrasives with larger primary particle size as shown in Fig. 3 (b). The\ncrystallite size of ceria abrasives was calculated from the Scherrer\nequation using the line-broadening of the (111) peak in the XRD\npattern. The crystallite size gradually increased from 38 nm to 88 nm\nas the calcination temperature and the concentration of additive were\nincreased. This result coincides with the trend of increasing primary\nparticle size in the FESEM images shown in the Fig. 2 .\nThe synthesis method employed in this study is characterized by a\nlow sintering temperature process, using grain growth accelerator.\nThe eutectic mixed solvents as an accelerator is used to promote the\nkinetics by enhancing diffusion, due to their low melting temperature.\nIn this study, potassium hydroxide/water mixed solvent was used as\nthe accelerator to reduce sintering temperature.

Oh et al. / Powder Technology 206 (2011) 239 \u2013245\nconventional sintering of ceria requires high temperatures leading to\npartial reduction above 1200 \u00b0C [12], potassium hydroxide/water\nmixed solvent might offer a liquid phase to promote interdiffusion on\ncontact surface between the smaller particle and the larger ones\nduring the sintering process. Fig. 4 shows this dependence of the\ncrystallite size on the concentration of potassium hydroxide at a\n\ufb01xed temperature (850 \u00b0C). It can be observed that an increase in\nthe crystallite size was seen with addition of KOH at same calcination\ntemperature. These results indicate that potassium hydroxide\nstrongly affects the growth rate of ceria particles at relatively low\ntemperature. Therefore, the physical properties and the morphology\nof ceria abrasives could be controlled by manipulating the concen-\ntration of potassium hydroxide in this system.\nAdditionally, cerium dioxide particles obtained by hydrothermal\nmethod were used as the precursor in this study, instead of cerium\nsalts such as hydroxide, nitride, and chloride. Fig. 5 shows the FESEM\nimages of the particles prepared with different cerium precursors.\nCompared with other particles as shown in Fig. 5 (a), (b), and (c), it\ncan be observed that the uniformity of ceria particles ( Fig. 5 (d))\nprepared using oxide is superior. This result is attributed to the fact\nthat in case of cerium dioxide as a precursor, direct grain growth of\ncrystallite is involved during heat treatment. However, in case of other\nprecursors (hydroxide, nitride and chloride), the formation of cerium\ndioxide crystallites involves two steps via thermal decomposition\nfollowed by grain growth. Thermal decomposition of such precursors\ninvolve series of chemical reactions [13]leading to retarded growth of\nceria particles. Furthermore, it is dif \ufb01cult to achieve uniform ceria\nparticle morphology because of the high surface energy and chemical\nreactivity of the volatile cerium compounds. Therefore, it seems that\nthe direct formation to ceria induces the absence of hard aggregates\nand surface necking in the ceria crystallites.3.2. Characteristics of ceria abrasives before and after CMP\nTo investigate the CMP performance using the synthesized ceria\nabrasives, we performed polishing test for the four types of slurries\nwith different abrasive size. Fig. 6 shows the particle size distribution\nof these slurries without surfactant addition. The average particle\nsizes determined by light scattering method were 165, 278, 483, and\n742 nm for slurry A, B, C and D, respectively. The dispersed particle\nsize is much larger than the crystallite size estimated by X-rays and\nthe primary particle size calculated by FESEM. This observation is due\nto the extensive overlapping of the ceria particles in water-based\nsolution [14]. As shown in Fig. 6 , the increase in the size of the primary\nparticle led to broader particle size distribution in water-based\nsolution.\nFig. 7 shows the FESEM images of ceria abrasives before and after\nsilicon dioxide polishing for slurry C. The ceria abrasives after polishing\nwere washed with distilled water three times via centrifugation.\nAccording to Fig. 6 , we can con \ufb01rm that the ceria abrasives are brittle\nand break during polishing process. This indicates that the ceria abra-\nsives used in this study are easily broken-down by applied pressure and\nshear force during polishing.\n3.3. Polishing test\nTable 2 summarizes the quantitative results of the polishing test. It\nis clear that the removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lms increased with increas-\ning size of ceria abrasives. The removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm is mainly\nin\ufb02uenced by chemical contribution of ceria abrasives and mechanical\nfactors, such as the CMP conditions, morphological characteristics of\nabrasives and particles size distribution. During the polishing of the\noxide \ufb01lm, ceria abrasives exhibit a chemical tooth property which\nFig. 2. FESEM photographs of the ceria abrasives prepared with different calcination conditions; (a) slurry A, (b) B, (c) C and (d) D.241 M.-H. Oh et al. / Powder Technology 206 (2011) 239 \u2013245\naccelerates the polishing removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm[1].A sa\nconsequence, the Si \u2013O\u2013Ce bonds can be rapidly removed by the\nmechanical force generated by pressed pad and abrasives, and this\nphysicochemical reaction lead to the high removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm. Inthis work, it was found that the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm was\nessentially dependent on the size of ceria abrasives. As with the removal\nrate of oxide \ufb01lm, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm increased with\nincreasing in the crystallite size of ceria abrasives. However, the removal\nrate of nitride \ufb01lm is affected by the physical properties of ceria-based\nslurry systems and the amount of surfactant adsorbed on the \ufb01lm\nsurface [5]. In order to improve the selectivity and uniformity, an anionic\nacrylic polymer is commonly used to passivate the surface of the nitride\n\ufb01lm during STI-CMP, which prevents ceria abrasives from contacting the\n\ufb01lm surface [15]. In this study, the amount of the polymer was\nmaintained constant for all slurry. Therefore, it seems that the increase\nin the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm is relate to the mechanical factors\nrather that to the effect of passivation layer of the polymer absorbed on\nthe\ufb01lm surface. These mechanical factors are in \ufb02uenced by several\nphysical parameters of the CMP process, such as morphological aspects\nof the abrasives, crystallite size of the abrasives and the CMP conditions.\nIt is well known that the removal rate increases with increasing\nparticle size due to mechanical indentation. However, the increase in\nremoval rate shows lower slope between slurry C and D as compared\nto that from slurry A to C as shown in Fig. 8 . This led to a transition in\nremoval selectivity between oxide and nitride \ufb01lm at slurry C. This\nresult is attributed to two related factors: the contact-area reduction\nand the particle surface activity. In the case of oxide CMP process, the\nremoval rate is mainly affected by contact area between the abrasives\nand the \ufb01lm surface. According to contact-area mechanism [16], the\nremoval rate increases with decreasing abrasive size and increasing\nsolid loading, due to the increase in contact-area between the\nabrasives and the \ufb01lm surface. At a \ufb01xed solid loading, the number\nof ceria abrasives in slurry decrease as the abrasive size increases. This\nimplies the decrease in contact area between ceria abrasives in slurry\nD and oxide \ufb01lm during CMP processing. Additionally, large abrasives\nwith round-shape lead to the decrease in interfacial contact with \ufb01lm\nsurface, due to their rolling motion [17]. Furthermore, relatively lower\nremoval rate are attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of\nslurry on the wafer. For the slurry D, the broader size distribution\ninduces a loss in the frictional occasion of smaller abrasives by bigger\nabrasives and a local friction interaction of bigger abrasives on the\nwafer. The frictional force between the abrasives and the wafer is\ndecreased by using slurry D because the frictional force is directly\nproportional to the contact area [18]. These polishing behaviors would\nlead to a relatively lower increase in removal rate for the oxide wafer\nduring CMP. In this study, such behavior can be clearly seen from the\nchange in oxide removal rate from slurry A to C and slurry C to D. As\nshown in Fig. 8 , the removal rate rapidly increased from 1662 \u00c5/min\nfor 84 nm to 3990 \u00c5/min for 295 nm, whereas it slightly increased to\n4343 nm for 417 nm in spite of size effect of bigger abrasives during\nCMP process. In case of the nitride \ufb01lm CMP, the polishing behavior\ncan be explained by the relationship between additive polymer and\nabrasive size. The additive polymer can be more easily attached on the\nsurface of the small abrasives than on the surface of large ones, due to\nhigh surface activity and speci \ufb01c surface area of the small abrasives.\nThe slurry with small abrasives can induce a relatively high removal\nrate for nitride \ufb01lm, since the passivation layer is insuf \ufb01ciently formed\non the nitride \ufb01lm surface as polymer is largely adsorbed on the\nparticle surface. As described in Table 1 , the speci \ufb01c surface area\ndecreased with increasing abrasive size. Moreover, the compositional\nchanges associated with the additive polymer adsorbed on the surface\nof ceria abrasives were investigated with thermal analysis. Fig. 9\npresents the TGA curves of the ceria abrasives dried from slurry A and\nD. The TGA curves of the ceria abrasives show two weight losses\n(curve (a) and (b)). The initial weight loss below the temperature of\n100 \u00b0C can be attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed\nwater in the air. The second weight loss observed at 200 \u2013260 \u00b0C is\nrelated to the decomposition of the additive polymer adsorbed on the\nabrasive surface. As shown in Fig. 9 ,\ufb01nal weight loss for two abrasives\nwas different because the additive polymer content adsorbed on\nFig. 3.

The variation of crystallite size as a function of the concentration of grain growth\naccelerator.242 M.-H. Oh et al. / Powder Technology 206 (2011) 239 \u2013245\nabrasive surface was different. This means that removal rate for\nnitride \ufb01lms can be relatively increased in spite of decrease in the\nabrasive size. As a result, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm showed\nrelatively low increase in rate with increase in the abrasive size.\nTherefore, these polishing behaviors for oxide and nitride \ufb01lms result\nin the transition of removal selectivity, suggestive of existence of an\noptimum size of ceria abrasives for high removal selectivity.\nAdditionally, the results for surface uniformity of the oxide \ufb01lms\nare shown in Fig. 10 . As the size of ceria abrasives increased, the slurry\nhad a higher WIWNU for the oxide \ufb01lm. This polishing behavior is\nFig. 5.

Oh et al. / Powder Technology 206 (2011) 239 \u2013245\nattributed to a broader particle size distribution of the slurry with\nlarge abrasives. The distribution data in Fig. 6 showed that the slurry\nhas a rather-wide particle size distribution as abrasive particles in-\ncreases. The broader particle size distribution of large abrasives can\ncause a different removal rate between the center and the edges of\nthe\ufb01lm surface due to their limited mobility on the wafer surface.\nConsequently, the surface uniformity deteriorated with increasing\nabrasive size during CMP process. It seems that surface uniformity of\noxide \ufb01lm is related to the mechanical factors of ceria abrasives rather\nthat to the morphological factors on the \ufb01lm surface.4. Conclusions\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of ceria abrasives on\npolishing performance during silicon dioxide and silicon nitride CMP.\nThe ceria abrasives with controllable size were synthesized using the\n\ufb02ux method. The size of the ceria abrasives was controlled by changing\nthe calcination conditions without mechanical milling process. With\nincreasing abrasive size, the removal rate of silicon dioxide and silicon\nnitride \ufb01lms increased. On the other hand, the surface uniformity\ndeteriorated after CMP process, due to a wide particle size distribution of\nthe slurry with large abrasives. In addition, the removal selectivity\nshowed a transition behavior at the slurry C (with particle size of\n295 nm). This result indicates that there exists an optimum for removal\nselectivity as a function of abrasive size in the used slurry system.\nTherefore, we concluded that the control of the size and uniform particlesize distribution of ceria abrasives is an important parameter for high\nremoval selectivity and surface uniformity in the CMP process.\nReferences\n[1] L.M.

The Zeta \npotential of  CeO2 dispersion were measured to show dispersing performance. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with \nurea condensation show good monodisperse properties. The material removal rate of silicon oxide and surface quality after \nchemical mechanical polishing were selected to evaluate the chemical mechanical polishing performance. The  CeO2 nanopar -\nticles synthesized with urea condensation not only yielded better surface quality results than the commercial slurry but also \nshowed a 153% (pH = 4) and 100% (pH = 10) increase in the material removal rate of silicon oxide compared to commercial.\nGraphical Abstract\nKeywords CeO2 nanoparticles\u00a0\u00b7 Calcination synthesis\u00a0\u00b7 Urea condensation\u00a0\u00b7 Chemical mechanical polishing\n1 Introduction\nWith the decreasing of critical dimension, Chemical \nMechanical Polishing (CMP) has played an increasingly \nimportant role in integrated circuit fabrication. It is widely believed that slurry is one of the important CMP consum-\nable materials [1 ]. In the logic chip manufacturing process, \nthere are many dielectric CMP processes [2 ], such as Shal-\nlow Trench Isolation (STI), Inter-level Dielectric (ILD) and \nPloy Silicon Open (POP) process, which need  CeO2 based \n * Xinchun Lu \n xclu@tsinghua.edu.cn1 State Key Laboratory of\u00a0Tribology, Tsinghua University, \nBeijing\u00a0100084, China\n581 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 \n1 3\nslurry [3 ]. The synthesis [ 4] of  CeO2 nanoparticles in  CeO2 \nbased slurry gains continuous emphasis on improving its \nperformance in the CMP of dielectric materials.\nThe physical properties of  CeO2 nanoparticles in  CeO2 \nbased slurry are significantly affected by the category and \ncircumstance of synthesis [5 ]. The CMP performances of \n CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized by different categories [6 ] \nand circumstances have been extensively investigated [7 ]. \nCalcination is a straightforward access to acquire  CeO2 \nnanoparticles [8 ]. Calcined  CeO2 has high  SiO2 Material \nRemoval Rate (MRR) [9 ] and good within-wafer uniform-\nity [7 ]. Previous studies [10] have shown that the higher \nthe calcination temperature, the higher the CMP MRR of \nceria [11]. Ceria calcined at 900 \u2103  has the highest MRR \n[12]. However, calcined  CeO2 is prone to sintering and \nagglomeration at high calcination temperatures [13]. In \ngeneral, calcined  CeO2 usually requires subsequent milling \nprocesses [14] to achieve the desired size [15], which con-\nsumes considerable energy [16]. Therefore, a new method \nthat can prevent agglomeration during the calcination of \nceria particle must be proposed.\nIn this work, urea was selected to dominate the growth of \nparticle during the calcination process. Therefore, the find-\nings in the manuscript provide the correlation between the \ngrowth state of  CeO2 nanoparticles and the calcination pro-\ncess controlled by urea [17]. In addition, the dispersion and \nCMP performance of the  CeO2 nanoparticles were measured.\n2  Experimental Procedure\n2.1  Synthesis of\u00a0Materials\nCalcination thermal decomposition was a common and \nwidespread process to synthesize  CeO2. In this research, \n Ce2(CO3)3\u00b76H2O was used as the source of ceria.\nUrea and  Ce2(CO3)3\u00b76H2O were mixed as a 1:1 molar \nratio to get a uniform paste. The other was prepared without \nurea. The paste was exsiccated to solid under a constant tem-\nperature oil bath condition at 70 \u2103 . The solid was calcined \nin muffle furnace at 900 \u2103  with a heating rate at 10\u00a0\u00b0C/\nmin, maintained at a constant temperature for 10\u00a0h and then \nnaturally cooled down to room temperature. The process of \nthe synthesis of  CeO2 nanoparticles with urea is shown in \nFig.\u00a0 1. The decomposition behavior of two kinds of exsic-\ncated solid was monitored by thermal gravimetric apparatus \n(TGA/DSC1, Mettler Toledo) up to 900 \u2103  at a heating rate \nof 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min in air.\n2.2  Materials Characterization\nThe size and morphology of  CeO2 were observed by scan-\nning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8200, Hitachi). The lattice structure and grain size were analyzed by the X-ray \ndiffraction (XRD, D/max-2550, Rigaku) using a Cu-K\u03b1 \nX-ray source (40\u00a0kV, 40 mA) in the range of 20\u201390\u00b0.\nThe valence states of cerium were carried out using \nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera II, \nUlvac-Phi). The fraction of  Ce3+ was calculated based on \nthe deconvolution [18] of Ce 3d spin-orbit doublet using \nCasa XPS.\n2.3  CMP Process\nCeO2 nanoparticles calcined with urea were dispersed in \ndeionized water, the mass content of the dispersion was \n0.3%, and the pH of the dispersion was adjusted by nitric \nacid and ammonia [19]. The  CeO2 dispersions were prepared \nby continuous ultrasonication and stirring for 10\u00a0h.\nThe particle size of dispersed  CeO2 nanoparticles \nwas measured by a laser particle size analyzer (380ZLS, \nPSS). The Zeta potential of dispersed  CeO2 nanoparticles \nwas measured by a zeta potential analyzer (90Plus PALS, \nBrookhaven).\n50\u00a0 mm Plasma-Enhanced Tetraethyl Orthosilicate \n(PETEOS) silicon oxide wafers were prepared by SKW \nAssociates, Inc. for CMP process. The thicknesses of the \nas-deposited oxide were 10 kA. Wafers were polished on a \nCMP machine (Universal-150Plus, Hwatsing) with a CMP \npad (DH3010, Dinglong). Ex-situ conditioning was car -\nried out with a diamond dresser (A165, 3\u00a0M) before each \npolishing. The head/platen rotational speed was 87/93\u00a0rpm, \nthe slurry flow rate was 150 ml/min, and the down pressure \nwas 3 psi. The main polishing time is 60\u00a0s. The commercial \nslurry for comparison is Ces333F from AGC.\nThe MRR of CMP process was calculated by the thick -\nness difference of wafers [20] before and after CMP process \nthat were measured by by Filmetrics (F50, Filmetric). The \nsurface quality after CMP process was observed by atomic \nforce microscope (AFM, Icon, Bruker). The average rough-\nness (Ra) was determined within 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 \u00b5m2.\nFig. 1  Flow chart of the synthesis of  CeO2 nanoparticles with urea\n582 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587\n1 3\n3  Results and\u00a0Discussion\n3.1  Surface Morphology of\u00a0 CeO2 Nanoparticles\nThe SEM images of the  CeO2 nanoparticles are shown \nin Fig.\u00a0 2, which provide the information of particle mor -\nphology. The shape of the  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized \nwith urea is near-spherical and shows good monodisperse \nproperties.\nIt is clear that the particle sizes of the two kinds of \n CeO2 are around 60\u00a0nm.  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized \nwithout urea are obviously agglomerated to form a strip \nparticle combination.  CeO2 usually has a strong precur -\nsor inheritance during the calcination process, so the strip \nparticle combination is likely to be the morphology of \ncerium carbonate [21].\nHowever, when urea is involved in the calcination pro-\ncess, the growth and combination of  CeO2 nanoparticles \nare significantly changed. This phenomenon can be attrib -\nuted to the thermal condensation reaction of urea [22]. \nThe condensation reaction of urea occurs in the two-way \nreaction of dissolution and precipitation of cerium carbon-\nate. The condensation product has a template effect so that \n CeO2 nanoparticles can grow in a monodisperse form [23].\nThe results of thermogravimetry experiments are \nshown in Fig.\u00a0 3, which could reflect the changes of phase \nin the calcination process. In the TG curve of the calci-\nnation process without urea, the low weight loss within \nlower temperature range (\u2264 100\u00a0\u00b0C) indicates that there is no loss of crystal water in the process. This result \nshows that the exsiccation process at 70\u00a0\u00b0C was suffi-\ncient. The rapid weight loss from 240 to 290\u00a0\u00b0C indicates \nthat cerium carbonate was rapidly decomposed. The TG \ncurve of the calcination process with urea is more com-\nplex. The slow weight loss begins at 80\u00a0\u00b0C, which could \nbe explained that urea began to react. Subsequently, the \ndecline rate of the curve changed at 240\u00a0\u00b0C. Cerium car -\nbonate began to decompose. Contrary to the previous \nrapid decline, the decomposition of cerium carbonate \ngradually completed with the increase of temperature. \nThis result shows that the decomposition of cerium \nFig. 2  SEM images of  CeO2 \nnanoparticles synthesized (a), \n(c)\u00a0without urea and (b), (d) \nwith urea\nFig. 3  Thermogravimetry (TG) curves of  CeO2 nanoparticles synthe-\nsized with urea and without urea\n583 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 \n1 3\ncarbonate and the growth of  CeO2 were affected by urea \ncondensation products.\n3.2  Surface and\u00a0Structural Properties\nXPS spectra in Figs.\u00a0 4 and 5  show the difference of the con-\ncentration of  Ce3+ between two kinds of  CeO2 nanoparticles. \nTable\u00a0 1 shows the concentration of  Ce3+ in the  CeO2 nanopar -\nticles conducted by peak deconvolution of XPS spectra [24].\nFigure\u00a0 6 shows the crystalline phase information of the \n CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea and with urea \nby XRD. The XRD patterns of  CeO2 nanoparticles remain the typical pattern of fluorite structure and correspond well \nwith the standard data of JCPDS No. 34-0394 [ 25]. Accord -\ning to the Debye-Scherrer equation, the crystallite size could \nbe calculated based on the broadening of the diffraction peak \nand the Bragg angle [26].\nThere are almost no differences in the concentration of \n Ce3+ and crystallite size between the two kinds of  CeO2 \nnanoparticles. Because of the presence of urea, the crystal-\nlinity of the product decreased slightly. However, urea con-\ndensation could not change the surface and structural prop-\nerties of  CeO2 nanoparticles. This result further confirms \nthat the urea condensation reaction only acts as a physical \ntemplate. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea \nhave the similar physical and chemical properties to general \ncalcined ceria.\n3.3  CMP Performance\nFigure\u00a0 7 compares the particle size of the two kinds of  CeO2 \nnanoparticles with different pH measured by dynamic light \nscattering [27]. Figure\u00a0 7a shows that the mean diameter of \n CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea is approxi-\nmately 600\u00a0nm with a wide distribution range.\nFigure\u00a0 7b\u2013d show that the  CeO2 nanoparticles synthe-\nsized with urea have good dispersion. Simultaneously, \nthe particle size had good stability and did not fluctuate \ngreatly with the change of pH value [28]. Table\u00a0 2 shows \nthe standard deviation of DLS particle sizes. Compared \nwith the initial particle size without regulating pH, the \nmean diameter was smaller and the particle size distri-\nbution was more concentrated at pH = 4 and pH = 10. \nTable\u00a0 2 also shows the Zeta potential of  CeO2 dispersion \nprepared by nanoparticles synthesized with urea at differ -\nent pH value. This result is consistent with the results of Table 1  The concentration of  Ce3+ of  CeO2 Synthesized with and \nwithout urea\nWith urea Without urea\nThe concentration of  Ce3+16.90% 16.27%\nCrystallinity 97.70% 99.31%\nCrystallite size (nm) 62.2 62.5\nFig. 4  XPS spectra of  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea\nFig. 5  XPS spectra of  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea\nFig. 6  XRD patterns of  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea \nand without urea\n584 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587\n1 3\nprevious studies on  CeO2 dispersions. Meanwhile, when \nthe pH is not regulated, that is, the pH is close to the iso-\nelectric point of ceria, the absolute value of Zeta potential \nof  CeO2 dispersion is lower and the dispersion is slightly \nworse, which also corresponds to the increase of mean \nparticle size. This phenomenon indicates that the  CeO2 \nnanoparticles synthesized with urea could be used as a \nFig. 7  DLS particle sizes of  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized (a) without urea and (b) with urea dispersed in water; synthesized with urea dis-\npersed in water at (c) pH = 4 and (d) pH = 10\nTable 2  The DLS particle size and Zeta potential of  CeO2 dispersion \nsynthesized with urea\npH = 4 Unregulated pH = 10\nMean diameter (nm) 235.3 265.7 243\nStandard deviation 100.9 111.8 75.8\nZeta potential (mV) 32.66 \u221212.79 \u221223.29\nFig. 8  MRR of PETEOS during CMP and surface roughness after \nCMP by using  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea dispersed in \nwater at different pH value compared with commercial slurry\n585 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 \n1 3\ngood basic material for the subsequent development of \nmultifunctional CMP slurry [29].\nThe MRR of PETEOS of CMP experiments are shown \nin Fig.\u00a0 8. The initial ceria without regulating pH showed a \nhigher MRR because of the bigger mean diameter. The MRR \nof PETEOS was higher in acidic slurry (at pH 4) than that in \nalkaline slurry (at pH 10), mainly due to the different elec-\ntrostatic interactions between abrasive and the wafer surface [30]. Three kinds of slurries all exhibited higher MRR than \ncommercial slurry.\nThe micro topographies after CMP process observed \nby AFM are shown in Figs.\u00a0 9 and 10. AFM results clearly \nreveal that CMP process using the  CeO2 dispersion prepared \nby nanoparticles synthesized with urea achieve ultra-smooth \nand damage-free surfaces.\nThe surface roughness (Ra) results after CMP process \nare shown in Fig.\u00a0 8. The  CeO2 dispersion prepared by \nFig. 9  2D-AFM height images of surfaces after CMP process by using  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea dispersed in water at (a) \npH = 4, (b)\u00a0unregulated pH and (c) pH = 10, compared with using (d) commercial slurry\n586 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587\n1 3\nnanoparticles synthesized with urea at unregulated pH \nhas a relatively poor surface quality due to the lower \nabsolute value of Zeta potential and larger particle size. \nCompared with commercial slurry, acidic slurry (at pH \n4) and alkaline slurry (at pH 10) both have a better sur -\nface quality.\nThese CMP results also increase the possibility of subse-\nquent development of multifunctional CMP slurry.\n4  Conclusions\nUrea was selected to dominate the growth and morphology \nduring the calcination process. The urea condensation prod-\nucts made the calcined  CeO2 exhibit good monodisperse \ncharacteristics by affecting the decomposition of cerium \ncarbonate and the growth of  CeO2. At the same time, the \nurea condensation reaction did not affect the crystal struc -\nture and surface properties of the calcined  CeO2. The  CeO2 \nnanoparticles synthesized with urea condensation had good \ndispersion in water at a wide pH value and satisfactory CMP \nperformance. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea \ncondensation not only yielded better surface quality results \nthan the commercial slurry but also showed a 153% (pH = 4) \nand 100% (pH  = 10) increase in the material removal rate \nof silicon oxide compared to commercial. The result of this \nresearch greatly reduces the energy consumption and time \nin the synthesis of calcined  CeO2 slurry. This research pro-\nvides a broad prospect for the subsequent development of \nCMP slurry.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural \nScience Foundation of China (No. 51991370).\nDeclarations The authors declare that they have no known competing financial in -\nterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper.\nReferences\n 1.

Introduction\nCerium  dioxide  is  one  of  the  most  important  rare-earth\noxide,  of  which  application  \ufb01elds  include  industrial  catalysts\n[1,2] ,  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFC)  [3,4] ,  polishing  abrasive\n[5,6]  and  other  \ufb01elds.  Especially,  CeO 2polishing  abrasive  for\nSTI-CMP  (Shallow  Trench  Isolation  Chemical  Mechanical\nPolishing)  has  been  received  widely  attention  in  recent  years\ndue  to  its  excellent  selectivity  and  ef\ufb01ciency.  To  satisfy\npolishing  requirements,  a  variety  of  cerium  oxide  synthesis\nmethods  have  been  extensively  studied  to  increase  cerium\ndioxide  performance  in  STI-CMP  process,  such  as  precipita-\ntion,  sol\u2013gel,  hydrothermal,  physical  chemistry,  and  high-\nenergy  dispersion.\nAs  we  known,  the  commercial  abrasive  particles  are  usually\nprepared  by  means  of  calcination,  gas  combustion  or  high-\nenergy  ball  milling  dispersion,  easily  leading  to  irregular  shape,\nsevere  agglomeration,  uneven  distribution  of  particles.  These\ndisadvantages  resulted  in  the  scratches  and  defects  of  polished\nsurface,  and  limited  the  CeO 2abrasive  further  application  in  the\ndecreasing  feature  size  of  integrated  circuits  in  the  semi-\nconductor  industry.In  this  paper,  we  proposed  to  replace  CeO 2-calcinated\nabrasive  with  CeO 2-colloid  abrasive  in  order  to  reduce\npolishing  defects.  Otherwise,  the  synthesized  colloids  should\nbe  crystalline  ceria  to  keep  its  high  polishing  selectivity.\n2.  Experimental\nThe  synthesis  process  was  similar  to  the  reference  [7,8] .  The\ndetails  were  described  as  follows  (Fig.  1):  cerium  source\nCe(NO 3)3/C16H2O,  buffer  CO(NH 2)2and  dispersant  PVP  were\ndissolved  into  a  certain  amount  of  deionized  water  with  a\nmagnetic  stirrer.  The  temperature  of  the  mixture  solution\ngradually  increased  from  room  temperature  to  the  set\ntemperature,  and  the  solution  should  be  kept  stirring  for  1  h.\nThen,  an  appropriate  amount  of  ammonia  was  added  dropwise\nwith  a  burette.  The  reaction  quickly  happened  within  a  few\nseconds,  and  the  solution  color  underwent  obviously  change  in\nfew  hours.  The  phenomenon  of  color  change  was  believed  to  be\ncorrelated  with  the  chemical  changes.  As  the  color  of  reaction\nsolution  turned  from  purple  into  pale  yellow,  the  Ce3+happened\nto  be  oxidized  into  Ce4+by  O2under  air  atmosphere.  The  possible\nchemical  reaction  is  stated  as  the  following  formulas  [9]:\nCe\u00f0NO 3\u00de3/C16H2O  \u00fe  3NH 3/C1H2O  !

Results  and  discussion\nIn  order  to  con\ufb01rm  the  possible  compound  in  the  powder\nsample  for  researching  the  actual  reaction  process,  the  sample\nwas  dried  at  room  temperature  in  the  semi-closed  crucible  for\nseveral  days.

Decomposition  of\nthe  structural  water  was  in  between  140  8C  and  215  8C.  The\nweight  loss  from  215  8C  to  305  8C  was  attributed  to  the\ndecomposition  of  a  side  product  of  cerium  oxycarbonate  [7],\ncorresponding  to  a  sharp  exothermic  peak  at  291  8C  in  the  DTA\ncurve.  The  exothermic  peak  around  450  8C  might  be  caused  by\nthe  oxidation  of  cerium  compound.  So,  it  could  be  concluded\nthat  the  synthesized  product  contained  not  only  ceria  but  also\nsome  other  materials.\nAs  we  know,  the  crystal  structure  of  pure  ceria  is  a  face-\ncentered  cubic  structure,  grouped  into  the  calcium  \ufb02uoride\n(CaF 2)  structural  type  with  space  group  Fm3m.  The  XRD\npattern  of  the  dried  ceria  colloids  (Fig.  3)  showed  a  good\nagreement  with  literature  data  (JCPDS  No.  34-0394).  The  main\nBragg  peaks  with  Miller  indices  (1  1  1),  (2  0  0),  (2  2  0),  (3  1  1),\n(2  2  2),  and  (4  0  0)  could  be  found  clearly.  The  pure  crystallized\nceria  could  be  obtained  at  lower  temperature.\nFig.  4  depicts  the  XPS  spectrum  of  the  CeO 2nanoparticles.\nPeaks  of  Ce  3d  and  O  1s  proved  the  existence  of  cerium  oxide.\nCe  3d  binding  energy  (BE)  peaks  were  consistent  with  that  of\nCe4+ions.  The  band  at  918.1  eV  should  be  one  of  the  3d104f0\nstate  of  the  Ce4+ions  [10,11] ,  compared  with  the  band  of\n916.5  eV  BE  in  the  reference  [12],  the  upward  shift  of  binding\nenergy  value  may  be  due  to  smaller  particle  size.  Here,  the\nsoftware  of  XPSPEAK41  was  used  to  mark  and  \ufb01t  the  Ce  3d\npeaks.The  aqueous  solution  with  concentration  of  0.1  mol  L/C01\ncerium  was  adopted  for  synthesis  of  ceria  colloids.  The  content\nof  PVP  was  30  g  L/C01.  The  TEM  images  of  ceria  colloids\nsynthesized  at  different  temperatures  for  72  h  are  shown  in\nFig.  5.  Obviously,  the  sample  synthesized  at  25  8C  had  severe\ncolloid  agglomeration  (Fig.  5(a)).  However,  the  sample\nsynthesized  at  65  8C  (Fig.  5(b))  indicated  a  better  dispersing\nbehavior.  Lower  temperature  might  restrain  the  dispersion\neffect  of  PVP  so  that  leaded  to  a  bad  dispersion  performance.  It\nmeans  that  the  dispersion  effect  of  PVP  requires  a  proper\ntemperature.\nGenerally,  the  content  of  ceria  colloids  in  the  solution\ndepends  on  the  concentration  of  cerium  salt  in  reaction\nprecursor.  In  the  study,  the  samples  with  different  cerium\ncontents  were  synthesized  to  con\ufb01rm  the  limit  concentration  of\nceria  hydrosol.  The  experimental  results  shown:  with  increas-\ning  concentration  of  cerium  salt  in  the  solution,  the\nprecipitation  started  to  appear  gradually.  When  the  concentra-\ntion  of  cerium  reached  up  to  0.2  mol  L/C01,  the  colloids  in  thesolution  could  not  keep  its  suspension  state  and  formed\nprecipitation  totally.  Fig.  6  shows  the  TEM  images  of  two  kinds\nof  cerium  concentration  samples.  It  could  be  found  that  each\ncolloid  was  consisted  of  several  10-nm-size  crystal  particles,\nand  ceria  colloids  were  not  monodispersed  actually.  The  CeO 2\ncolloids  obtained  from  the  solution  of  0.05  mol  L/C01cerium  (a)\npossessed  a  better  dispersion  performance  than  that  of\nFig.  7.

The  experimental  facts  indicated  the\nstability  of  ceria  hydrosol  is  relative  to  the  concentration  of\ncerium  salt.\nFig.  7(a)\u2013(c)  shows  TEM  images  of  the  samples  prepared  at\ndifferent  reaction  times.  It  could  be  seen  that  the  effect  of\nreaction  time  on  crystallinity  of  ceria  is  obvious.  With  increase\nof  reaction  time,  the  reciprocal  lattice  of  patterns  became  more\nand  more  evident,  which  proved  a  well-crystallized  ceria.  Size\nof  the  ceria  colloids  not  changed  obviously  with  increase  of\nreaction  time.\nCeria  particles  are  easy  to  form  aggregation.  To  verify  the\nstability  of  cerium  oxide  hydrosol,  the  sample  stored  three\nmonths  was  measured  by  TEM.  The  colloids  had  no  signi\ufb01cant\nfurther  agglomeration  compared  with  fresh  sample  (similar  to\nFig.  7).  The  hydrosol  is  stable  enough  for  application.\n4.  Conclusions\nWell-dispersed  ceria  hydrosol  was  obtained  via  the  sol\u2013gel\nprocess  at  65  8C.  The  ceria  colloids  possessed  face-centered\ncubic  CaF 2structure.  The  grain  size  is  in  the  range  of  several\nnanometers  to  more  than  10  nm.  The  hydrosol  also  exhibited  a\ngood  aging  stability  in  three  months.\nReferences\n[1]  S.

The CeO 2abrasives with high chemical activity were prepared by the molten salt method under a\nreducing atmosphere. The crystal structure and morphology of CeO 2abrasives were characterized by X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet evisible diffuse re \ufb02ectance spectroscopy (UV eVis DRS),\nand X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The CeO\n2abrasives were obtained under different atmo-\nspheres (Air, Ar, and Ar/H 2). With the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, the morphology of the\nabrasives transforms from spherical to octahedral, while more oxygen vacancies and Ce3\u00feare generated on\nthe surface of CeO 2abrasives. The CMP experiments show that the MRR sof the CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and\nCeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives on SiO 2substrates are 337.60, 578.74, and 691.28 nm/min, respectively. Moreover, as\ncon\ufb01rmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the substrate surfaces exhibit low roughness (~0.5 nm) after\nbeing polished using all of the prepared samples. Especially, the MRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is increased\nby 104.76% compared with CeO 2-air abrasives.

Introduction\nCMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing)1is a key technology in\nadvanced semiconductor manufacturing processes.2It mainly re-\nlies on chemical and mechanical synergy to realize the material's\nglobal \ufb02attening.3With the development of semiconductor process\nnodes, CMP technology has become more and more important and\nhas become an indispensable planarization process for processes\nbelow 0.35 mm.4The slurry and pad of the polishing in the CMP\nsystem are the main consumables, and the polishing slurry as an\nactive material can signi \ufb01cantly affect the polishing performance.Ceria is considered to be the most effective abrasive for polishing\nSiO 2substrates due to their unique physical and chemical proper-\nties. With the increase in the number and density of multilayer\nwiring, the circle of CMP process steps has increased signi \ufb01cantly,\nand the impact on the yield of subsequent processes has become\ngreater and greater. Therefore, it is a hot research topic to enhance\nthe polishing ef \ufb01ciency by improving the chemical activity of the\nabrasive itself rather than increasing the polishing pressure (Higher\ndownforce results in worse surface quality after CMP5).\nThe \u201cchemical tooth \u201dtheory proposed by Cook6contributed to\nthe study of the polishing mechanism of ceria-based abrasives. The\nformation and destruction of the Ce eOeSi bond between CeO 2\nabrasives and SiO 2substrate is the key to realizing material\nremoval. The role of Ce3\u00fein CeO 2abrasives in enhancing this re-\naction has been widely recognized by researchers. Srinivasan et al.7\ndiscovered that Ce3\u00feon the surface of CeO 2abrasives is the key to\nachieving the removal of SiO 2materials. Kim et al.8studied the\npolishing performance of CeO 2abrasives with different speci \ufb01c\nsurface areas and concluded that the small-sized CeO 2has a higher*Foundation item: Project supported by the National Natural Science Foun-\ndation of China (51905324), the Scienti \ufb01c Research Program Funded by Shaanxi\nProvincial Education Department (20JK0545), and the Doctoral Scienti \ufb01c Research\nStartup Foundation of Shaanxi University of Science and Technology (2018BJ-14).\n*Corresponding author.

Therefore, the defects on the ceria surface can enhance the\nchemical activity of the abrasive, which improves the polishing\nperformance. Doping is a common way to enhance the chemical\nactivity of nanoceria. Younis et al.9showed that Gd3\u00fedoping\nenhanced the degradation performance of CeO 2particles on\norganic dyes, and the enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to\nthe formation of surface defects on CeO 2induced by ion doping.\nCheng et al.10improved the polishing ef \ufb01ciency of CeO 2abrasives\nby modifying the surface of commercial particles by ion doping.\nFurthermore, Kim et al.11directly synthesized La3\u00feand Nd3\u00fedoped\nnano-ceria by a traditional hydrothermal method and con \ufb01rmed\nthe signi \ufb01cant effect of doped abrasives on enhancing CMP per-\nformance for SiO 2substrates. These results are attributed to the\nincreased Ce3\u00feconcentration on the CeO 2abrasive surface by ion\ndoping.\nIn the chip manufacturing process, a \ufb01ne post-CMP cleaning\nprocess is also required to remove the impurity adhesion after\nCMP.12The ion doping can increase the MRR, but post-cleaning of\nthe wafer surface contaminated by impurity ions will become\ndif\ufb01cult, which will affect the chip quality and even damage the\ndevice.13Therefore, the preparation of CeO 2abrasives by control-\nling atmospheric conditions without introducing impurity ions is\nan ideal way to increase the Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive\nsurface. Choudhury et al.14prepared cerium oxide particles with\nhigh oxygen vacancy concentration under vacuum conditions,\nwhich exhibited better catalytic performance than CeO 2prepared\nunder air. Lan and Sohn15studied cerium oxide prepared under\ndifferent atmosphere conditions (Air, N 2,H 2), and the results\nshowed that under a reducing atmosphere, cerium oxide has good\ncatalytic performance due to the formation of more oxygen va-\ncancies. However, its wide particle size range and agglomeration\nbehavior cannot be applied in the CMP \ufb01eld. Moreover, the rela-\ntionship between the oxygen vacancies of CeO 2surface and Ce3\u00fe\nconcentration under the reducing atmosphere has not been deeply\nstudied. To improve the polishing ef \ufb01ciency of conventional CeO 2\nabrasives on SiO 2substrates, the CeO 2abrasives were prepared by\nthe molten salt method in Air, Ar, and Ar/H 2atmospheres, respec-\ntively, to clarify the in \ufb02uence of CeO 2abrasives prepared in\ndifferent atmospheres on the polishing performance of SiO 2sub-\nstrate. Through detailed characterization studies, the evolution of\ncrystal structure and micro-morphological of CeO 2abrasives were\nanalyzed. Although the effect of Ce3\u00fein CeO 2abrasives on polishing\nperformance has been con \ufb01rmed, the relationship between the\natmospheric environment and the formation of Ce3\u00feon the abra-\nsive surface remains to be further elucidated. In this work, the in-\n\ufb02uence of reducing atmosphere on the concentration of Ce3\u00feon the\nabrasive surface was emphatically investigated. Moreover, the\npolishing performance of CeO 2abrasives prepared in reducing at-\nmosphere and air were compared, and the role of the prepared\nCeO 2abrasives on the removal ef \ufb01ciency of SiO 2substrate was\ninvestigated. Finally, the polishing mechanism of the CeO 2abra-\nsives was discussed through the comprehensive analysis of the\nmorphology, defect characteristics, and polishing performance of\nthe abrasives. To the best of our knowledge, the preparation of CeO 2\nabrasives by reducing the atmosphere-assisted molten salt method\nto enhance the CMP performance on SiO 2substrates has not been\nfound to be reported yet.\n2. Experimental2.1. Chemical reagents\nCerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO\n3)3,6H2O), potassium chlo-\nride (KCl), and sodium chloride (NaCl) are all analytical reagents,and they were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,\nLtd (China). Analytical reagent ethanol was purchased from Tianjin\nFuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (China). Homemade deionized water\nwas used throughout the experiment. All chemicals were used\nwithout further puri \ufb01cation. Ar (100% purity) and Ar/H 2(H2con-\ncentration of 5%) were used for the experiments.\n2.2. Preparation method\nThe molten salt method was used to prepare CeO 2powder, and\nthe synthesis steps were as follows. Firstly, the weighed Ce(N-\nO3)3,6H2O (2.1711 g), KCl (1.8638 g), and NaCl (1.4610 g) were well\nground in an agate mortar. The raw materials in ethanol were\nmixed completely by magnetic stirring at 300 r/min for 30 min. The\nmixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a\nconstant temperature oven at 80/C14C to remove absolute ethanol.\nThen, the OTF-1200X eS tubular atmosphere furnace (Hefei Kejing\nMaterial Technology Co., Ltd., China) was used to prepare a mixture\ncontaining ceria powder under a certain temperature regime (react\nat 800 and 700/C14C for 2 h, respectively). After cooling down to\nambient temperature, the molten salts (KCl eNaCl) in the mixture\nwere washed with hot deionized water to obtain high purity CeO 2\npowder. In another experiment, the crucible containing themixture was heated in the tube furnace with a constant \ufb02ow\n(60 mL/min) of Ar or Ar/H\n2, respectively, and in the same temper-\nature regime to explore the effect of the surrounding atmosphere.\nIn this work, the abrasives prepared under air, Ar, and Ar/H 2at-\nmospheres were named CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2,\nrespectively.\n2.3. Characterization methods\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders were\nrecorded on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) under\nthe condition of Cu K aradiation range of 20/C14e120/C14, and the scan-\nning speed was \ufb01xed at 3(/C14)/min, the Rietveld re \ufb01nement of pow-\nders was characterized using the GSAS program. Fourier transform\ninfrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using an FT-IR spectrometer\n(Bruker, Germany) within the IR range of 500 e4000 cm/C01. The\nmorphology of the powders was observed with a scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM, Hitachi Regulus 8100, Japan) under secondary\nelectronic mode. Detailed information on morphology and struc-\nture was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI\nTecnai G2 F20, USA). Ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectra were recorded\nwith a Cary 5000 UV eViseNIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Tech-\nnologies, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo\nScienti \ufb01c K-Alpha, USA) with Al K arays ( hv\u00bc1486.6 eV) as the\nexcitation source was used for analysis at room temperature, and\nthe binding energy was calibrated with adsorbed carbon (284.8 eV),\nand the semi-quantitative analysis of the atomic ratio was achieved\nby measuring the element peak area.\n2.4. Polishing experiment\nThe homemade CeO 2abrasive was dispersed in deionized water\nusing a ball mill and run at 400 r/min for 5 h. After suf \ufb01cient\ndispersion, the slurry was diluted with deionized water to make the\nsolid content 0.5 wt%, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with 1 mol/L\nNaOH solution. The slurry was stirred well by using a magnetic\nstirrer before the start of the CMP experiment. The quartz glass\nwith the nominal speci \ufb01cations of 20 mm diameter and 2 mm\nthickness was purchased from Lianyungang Xiongtai Quartz Tech-\nnology Co., Ltd. A UNIPOL-1200S automatic pressure grinding and\npolishing machine (Shenyang Kejing Auto-instrument, Co., Ltd.,\nChina) equipped with a synthetic leather polishing pad (ShenyangN. Xu, J. Ma, Q. Liu et al. Journal of Rare Earths 41 (2023) 1627 e1635\n1628\nKejing Auto-instrument, Co., Ltd., China) was used for CMP exper-\niments. The polishing parameters were set as follows: the platform\nspeed was 80 r/min, the reverse speed of the polishing head was 80\nr/min, the pressure applied by the head was 3.5 kg, and the pol-\nishing time was 3 min, and the slurry supply rate was 50 mL/min.\nThe polished quartz glass was cleaned repeatedly in deionized\nwater by ultrasonic and dried for characterization of CMP perfor-\nmance. Surface morphology and roughness were examined by us-\ning an atomic force microscope (AFM, Seiko SPA400-SP13800N,\nJapan) equipped with a silicon nitride tip in contact mode at a scan\nrate of 1.0 Hz over a scan area of 5 mm/C25mm. The weight of the\nworkpiece was measured using a precision electronic balance with\nan accuracy of 0.1 mg. The polishing ef \ufb01ciency or material removal\nrate (MRR, nm/min) was calculated by the following Eq. (1).16:\nMRR \u00bcm0/C0m\nr/C2S/C2t(1)\nwhere m0and mare the mass of the workpiece before and after\npolishing, respectively, ris the density of the commercial quartz\nglass used (2.2 g/cm3),Sthe area of the workpiece ( p$cm2), and t\nthe polishing time (3 min). In this experiment, the MRR and\nroughness data presented are the average of three experiments\nperformed repeatedly.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Morphology and structure characterization of CeO 2abrasives\nThe XRD patterns of the prepared CeO 2particles are recorded in\nFig. 1 . All diffraction peaks of the samples match well with the CeO 2\nphase of face-centered cubic (fcc) \ufb02uorite (JCPDS 34 e0394), and no\nother cerium oxides (Ce 2O3species) are found. The peak position\nanalysis of each diffraction spectrum showed that the crystalstructure of CeO\n2prepared under different atmospheres changed.\nThe magni \ufb01cation of the diffraction peaks shows that the diffrac-\ntion peak positions of the samples synthesized under Ar and Ar/H 2\natmospheres are shifted to a higher angle, which may be due to thelattice contraction caused by more oxygen vacancies. The Rietveld\nre\ufb01nement of CeO\n2samples was characterized using the GSAS\nprogram to further con \ufb01rm subtle changes in the structure of CeO 2\nparticles, as shown in Figs. S1(a ec). The Rietveld re \ufb01nement was\nattempted using a CeO 2phase with a face-centered cubic ( Fm-3m)\nstructure. The red circle, the black line, and the blue line represent\nthe recorded, calculated and different pro \ufb01les for the CeO 2powder,\nrespectively. For all samples, the re \ufb01nement parameters ( Rp<7%,\nRwp<9%, and Chi2<2) are within a accepted range, indicating that\nthe results of re \ufb01nement are credible. The results show that the\nlattice constants and volume of CeO 2-Ar (0.54132 nm, 0.15862 nm3)\nand CeO 2-Ar/H 2(0.54130 nm, 0.15860 nm3) are smaller than CeO 2-Air (0.54137 nm, 0.15867 nm3). This further con \ufb01rms the formation\nof oxygen vacancies in the CeO 2crystal. The oxygen vacancies\npromote the conversion of Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00fefor unit cell charge bal-\nance,17which is responsible for the increase in Ce3\u00feconcentration\nin CeO 2.18,19\nThe FT-IR spectra of the abrasives are shown in Fig. 2 . The\nspectra were studied to characterize changes in chemical bonds\nand molecular vibrations, and evaluate the formation of the abra-\nsives. The broad absorption band at 3456 cm/C01is due to the pres-\nence of the H eOeH stretching mode attributed to the adsorbed\nwater on the CeO 2abrasive surface.20e22The bands at 2927 and\n2855 cm/C01indicate the C eH stretching mode of the methylene\ngroups,21,23and the peak intensity is weakened after synthesis by\nreducing atmosphere, which indicates that the adsorption of CO 2by\nCeO 2particles is reduced. The bands located at 2160 and 2028 cm/C01\nare due to the stretching vibration of C eH, and CH 2groups, asso-\nciated with some of the organic moieties which get physically\nadsorbed on the surface during sample preparation and handling.21\nThe peaks between 1047 and 1630 cm/C01correspond to the Ce eO\nstretching vibrations attributed to the hydrogenated CeO 2sam-\nple.20,21The enhancement of the vibrational peak with the reducing\natmosphere indicates that the sensitivity of CeO 2abrasives to hy-\ndroxyl groups is elevated, which favors the adsorption of abrasives\nto SiO 2substrates. Meanwhile, the existence of the peak at\n716 cm/C01in the IR spectra is attributed to the asymmetric\nstretching vibrations between O eCeeO atoms.23,24Furthermore, it\nveri\ufb01es the bonding of metal eoxygen existing in the CeO 2lattice,\nwhich is consistent with the XRD results.\nFig. 3 shows the SEM images of the CeO 2abrasives synthesized\nunder different atmospheres. There are signi \ufb01cant differences in\nthe morphology of the particles. From Fig. 3 (aec), it can be seen\nthat the CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives are spherical,\npolyhedral, and octahedral, respectively. Fig. 3 (d) shows the sche-\nmatic diagram of the effect of the atmosphere on the morphology\nof the abrasives. It is considered that the morphology of CeO 2\nparticles is gradually transformed from spherical to octahedral withthe enhancement of the reducing atmosphere. The morphology of\nCeO\n2abrasives is one of the factors affecting the CMP performance,\nand the detailed mechanism of the change of morphology of CeO 2\nparticles during the synthesis will be focused on in our next study.SEM images also show that all abrasives are in the size range of\n200e300 nm, which weakens the in \ufb02uence of abrasive size effect\non CMP results.\nThe TEM images were acquired to further observe the\nmorphology and structure of CeO\n2abrasives. Obviously, with the\nenhancement of reducibility, the morphology of CeO 2particles\nchanges signi \ufb01cantly. As indicated by the red marks in\nFigs. S2(a ec), the morphologies of CeO 2particles are spherical,\nFig. 1. XRD patterns of the CeO 2abrasives prepared under the different atmospheres\n(Air, Ar, Ar/H 2).\nFig. 2. FT-IR spectra of CeO 2abrasives prepared under the different atmospheres (Air,\nAr, Ar/H 2).N. Xu, J. Ma, Q. Liu et al. Journal of Rare Earths 41 (2023) 1627 e1635\n1629\npolyhedral, and octahedral in order, which is consistent with the\nSEM results. As shown in Figs. S2(d ef), the boundaries of CeO 2\nparticles can be observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)\nimages, and the clear lattice fringe spacing of CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar,\nand CeO 2-Ar/H 2particles are 0.318, 0.304 and 0.302 nm, respec-\ntively, which correspond to the CeO 2(111) plane. The results show\nthat the spacing of CeO 2particles is slightly reduced with the\nenhancement of the reducibility of the atmosphere. This is attrib-\nuted to the lattice contraction caused by the generation of oxygen\nvacancies.\nUVeVis spectroscopy techniques can be used to obtain infor-\nmation on the oxidation state of metal oxide species. The infor-\nmation about the valence state of the Ce element in the preparedCeO\n2samples was preliminarily analyzed by UV eVis spectros-\ncopy.25It is considered that the absorption peak of CeO 2at 260 nm\nis attributed to Ce3\u00fe, and the absorption peak at 330 nm is attrib-\nuted to Ce4\u00fe.26,27Fig. 4 shows the UV eVis spectra of the as-\nprepared abrasives, CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have high\npeak intensities, indicating that CeO 2abrasives prepared under a\nreducing atmosphere can increase the Ce3\u00feconcentration. The\nCeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have similar Ce3\u00fe\nconcentrations.XPS is an analytical technique that detects the composition,\nchemical state, and concentration of elements on the material\nsurface. The surface chemical composition and valence states of the\nCeO 2samples were analyzed by XPS spectroscopy. Fig. 5 (a) shows\nthe XPS survey spectra of the particles. The spectra show that only\nCe, O, and C elements are detected, and no Cl, Na, or K elements are\npresent in the samples, which also indicates the synthesis of CeO 2\nas a single phase. Numerous studies28e32have shown that the\nchemical activity of CeO 2material is closely related to the con-\ncentrations of oxygen vacancy and Ce3\u00fe. Therefore, the \ufb01ne spectra\nof Ce 3d and O 1s were analyzed in detail by \ufb01tting. The spin eorbit\nsplitting energies of the samples are 18.44, 18.44, and 18.30 eV,\nrespectively, which are consistent with the reports.33The uand v\nare usually used to label the spin orbitals 3d 3/2and 3d 5/2, where the\nv0,v',u, and u' peaks are characteristic peaks of Ce3\u00feand the v,v\",\nv\"',u0,u\", and u\"' peaks belong to Ce4\u00fe.33,34As shown in\nFigs. S3(a ec), the nonlinear peak \ufb01tting method was used to\nidentify the peaks of Ce3\u00feand Ce4\u00fe, indicating the presence of both\nCe3\u00feand Ce4\u00festates in the samples. Table 1 shows the binding\nenergies and peak areas of CeO 2samples (Air, Ar, Ar/H 2) repre-\nsenting different Ce states. Using the semi-quantitative analysis of\nthe integrated peak area, the Ce3\u00feconcentration could be calcu-\nlated according to Eq. (2).34Fig. 5 (b) shows the statistics of Ce3\u00fe\nconcentration on the CeO 2abrasive surface. In this work, the Ce3\u00fe\nconcentrations on the surface of CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2\nabrasives were 23.03 at%, 29.58 at%, and 33.88 at%, respectively. The\nimprovement of Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface in-\ncreases with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, which\nwas consistent with the UV eVis results. And this change indicates\nthat there is a state transition between Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00fe, which is\nexcellent for enhanced polishing ef \ufb01ciency.\nCe3\u00fe\nCe3\u00fe\u00feCe4\u00fe\u00bcArea\u00f0v0;u0;v0;u0\u00de\nTotal area(2)\nFigs.

The peak named O1 can be attributed to lattice\noxygen, and the binding energies of this peak for CeO 2samples\nprepared under different atmospheres are 529.43 eV (Air),\n529.02 eV (Ar), 528.94 eV (Ar/H 2), respectively. The peaks (O2) with\nbinding energies of 531.52 eV (Air), 531.49 eV (Ar) and 531.36 eV\nFig. 3.

The peak po-\nsitions of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2samples are shifted to relatively\nlow binding energies, indicating that the reducing atmosphere has\na signi \ufb01cant effect on the chemical environment of oxygen in CeO 2\nsamples. The concentrations of oxygen vacancy on the abrasive\nsurface can be obtained by calculating the integral ratio of the \ufb01tted\npeak areas, which are 19.92 at% and 22.17 at% for CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-\nAr/H 2surfaces, much higher than CeO 2-Air (17.81 at%). It con \ufb01rms\nthat the preparation of CeO 2abrasives under a reducing atmo-\nsphere can effectively reduce the lattice oxygen and improve the\noxygen defects on its surface.\nIn a reducing atmosphere, the lattice oxygen is spilled out as\nneutral O 2molecules and oxygen vacancies are generated in the\nCeO 2lattice. The electrons released by the over \ufb02ow of O 2molecules\nare bound around the oxygen vacancy. To keep the crystal electri-\ncally neutral, Ce4\u00fein the CeO 2crystal gains electrons and turns into\nthe lower valence Ce3\u00fe, the reaction of defect formation is shown in\nEq.(3). As a result, more oxygen vacancies and Ce3\u00fewere formed\non the surface of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives compared to\nCeO 2-Air abrasives, which facilitated the polishing activity of CeO 2-\nbased abrasives.\n2Ce Ce\u00fe4OO\u00bc2Ce0\nCe\u00feV::\nO\u00fe3OO\u00fe1\n2O2[ (3)\n3.2. The polishing performance of CeO 2abrasives\n3.2.1. Material removal rate (MRR) of CeO 2abrasives on SiO 2\nsubstrates\nMRR is one of the important indicators to evaluate the polishing\nperformance of abrasives. Fig. 6 illustrates the MRR of CeO 2abra-\nsives on SiO 2substrates, the MRR of CeO 2-Air abrasives is the lowest\nat 337.60 nm/min, the MRR of CeO 2-Ar abrasives is higher at\n578.74 nm/min, and the MRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is the highestat 691.28 nm/min under the same working conditions. The MRR of\nCeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives increased by 71.43% and\n104.76%, respectively, compared with CeO 2-Air abrasives. These\nresults reveal that the abrasives synthesized under a reducing at-mosphere have excellent polishing ef \ufb01ciency. In this work, the Ce\n3\u00fe\nconcentration and morphology of the CeO 2abrasives synthesized\nunder different atmospheres showed a large variation. The trend of\nCe3\u00feconcentration is consistent with the improved MRR of abra-\nsives. It is generally accepted that the \ufb02attening of rough surfaces\ninvolves chemical bonding and mechanical wear between the\nabrasives and the surface in CMP. Seo et al.29believed that the Ce3\u00fe\nconcentration could improve the chemical adsorption capacity\nbetween the abrasives and the surface. Kim et al.37believed that\nphysical morphology is an important factor in enhancing polishing\nbehavior. Therefore, the signi \ufb01cant enhancement of polishing ef \ufb01-\nciency of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is attributed to the\nincrease of Ce3\u00feconcentration on the surface of the abrasives\nsynthesized under the reducing atmosphere. Furthermore, the\nFig. 5.

Journal of Rare Earths 41 (2023) 1627 e1635\n1631\nMRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is improved by 19.45% compared with\nCeO 2-Ar abrasives, which may be attributed to the octahedral\nmorphology that enhances mechanical interaction during CMP. In\naddition, we collected the values of MRR for different types of CeO 2-\nbased abrasives in some works, as shown in Fig. S4 . For the core/\nshell abrasives, the present results show a poor MRR, although the\nstructure of the abrasive has been designed and regulated to\nimprove CMP performance, it is still far from being suitable for\nlarge-scale commercial use. For the doped abrasives, it is believed\nthat the doping increases the Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive\nsurface, which enhances the MRR. However, impurity ions of the\nabrasives during the polishing will pollute the surface of the sub-\nstrate leading to dif \ufb01culties in CMP cleaning, and residual impurity\nions will negatively affect or even damage the device. Under the\nexisting studies and applications, it is very feasible to enhance MRR\nby adjusting the physical properties (size and morphology) of pure\nCeO 2abrasive, but the improvement of the approach is limited. In\nthis work, the pure CeO 2abrasives synthesized under a reducing\natmosphere not only changed the morphology but also improved\nthe chemical activity of the CeO 2abrasives, which together\nimproved the removal ef \ufb01ciency.\n3.2.2. Surface quality of SiO 2substrates after CMP\nTo con \ufb01rm the effect of material surface quality after polishing\nwith homemade abrasives. As shown in Fig. 7 , the surface\nmorphology of the quartz glass was characterized using AFM. The\ntwo-dimensional surface morphology of quartz glass before and\nafter polishing are shown in Fig. 7 (aed). The light and dark colors in\nthe graph show the surface roughness, where dark areas indicate\nthe valleys and light areas indicate the peaks. Concretely, the\nroughness average ( Ra) and the root mean square roughness ( Rq)o f\nthe surface are shown in Fig. 7 (f). The initial roughness of quartz\nglass is 0.955 nm, and all of them are improved (0.391, 0.537, and\n0.521 nm) after polishing with the CeO 2slurry, in which the pol-\nishing slurry formulated with CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasivessynthesized under reducing atmosphere has poorer polishing\nperformance in surface quality. The difference in surface quality\nafter polishing may be caused by the different morphology of\nabrasives. The sharped morphology reduced contact areas between\nabrasives and surfaces, which leads to enhanced contact stress\nreducing the surface quality.38As shown in Fig. 7 (e), the pro \ufb01le\nroughness in the selected area (the diagonal in Fig. 7 (aed)) was also\nanalyzed, where the Z-axis represents the depth of the line pro \ufb01le,\nand the X-axis represents the length. The improved surface pla-\nnarization degree can be con \ufb01rmed by reduced topographical\nvariations. Moreover, compared with the initial surface, rough\npeaks or valleys are evenly distributed on the polished surface,\nwhich is conducive to the improvement of the overall surface\nquality.\n3.3. CMP mechanism of CeO 2abrasives prepared under reducing\natmosphere\nIn this work, CeO 2abrasives were prepared under the reducing\natmosphere. The surface quality of the SiO 2substrate was signi \ufb01-\ncantly improved after polishing with the abrasives. In particular,\nthe abrasives have excellent polishing ef \ufb01ciency, which is attrib-\nuted to a combination of the following factors. The analysis of the\nstructure and chemical valence of the as-prepared CeO 2particles\nshowed that the surface of the abrasive has a higher Ce3\u00fecon-\ncentration. The CMP performance also con \ufb01rmed that the polishing\nef\ufb01ciency of the abrasives with a high Ce3\u00feconcentration is\nsigni\ufb01cantly improved. There may be a positive function between\nthe Ce3\u00feconcentration and MRR, which may be due to the electron\ntransfer of Ce3\u00fepromoting Ce eOeSi bond breaking. Furthermore,\nthe polishing results also show that the MRR of the CeO 2-Ar/H 2\nabrasives is 19.45% higher than that of the CeO 2-Ar abrasives even\nwhen the chemical activity (Ce3\u00feconcentration) is similar, which\nmay be attributed to the effect of abrasive morphology.\nFig. 7.

The synergy of chemistry and mechanics in the CMPprocess is what makes the material surface \ufb02at. The CeO\n2abrasives\nnot only have moderate mechanical properties but also provide\nchemical activity in the CMP process. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the\nCeO 2abrasives with nearly spherical morphology were prepared\nunder air, and the contact stress is small under the downforce,\nwhich only removes the super \ufb01cial atoms on the surface. The\nspherical particles may have both sliding and rolling removal be-\nhaviors on SiO 2substrates. The sliding friction behavior of abrasives\nis considered to be the main mode of material removal, while the\nrolling behavior of some abrasives weakens the material removal\nability due to reduced friction. As shown in Fig. 8 (b), the CeO 2\nabrasives with octahedral morphology were prepared under a\nreducing atmosphere. Its sharp edges enable the abrasives to have\nstronger compressive stress at the contact surface. On the one hand,\nit increases the material removal from the deeper layers of the\nsubstrate by the abrasives during the CMP, and on the other hand,\nthe enhanced mechanical action further promotes the chemical\nreaction at the interface. As shown in Fig. S5 , the stress distributionon the surface of the SiO 2substrate when the spherical and octa-\nhedral abrasives were indented at a depth of 50 nm was simulated\nby\ufb01nite element analysis (FEA), respectively. The abrasives with\noctahedral morphology achieved the same indentation depth as\nspherical particles under lower compressive stress, which veri \ufb01es\nthat the abrasives with octahedral morphology have a higher MRR.\nThe chemical activity of the CeO 2abrasives is an advantage that\ndistinguishes it from other abrasives, which signi \ufb01cantly enhances\nthe CMP performance of the abrasives. As shown in Fig. 8 (c), the\nCeO 2abrasives reacted with the SiO 2substrate to form Ce eOeSi\nbonds in the slurry, the offset of the electron cloud strengthens the\nCeeOeSi bonds and weakens the Si eOeSi bonds, then the surface\nlayer of the substrate is removed by abrasives under the mechanical\nforce. As shown in Fig. 8 (d), Ce4\u00feon the surface of the CeO 2abra-\nsives is reduced to Ce3\u00fewith higher reactivity under the reducing\natmosphere. After the Ce eOeSi bond is formed between the\nabrasives and the substrate surface, the free electrons in Ce3\u00febreak\nthe Si eOeSi bond through electron transfer, which signi \ufb01cantly\nincreases the material removal ef \ufb01ciency.\nIn the CMP, the hydrated surface layer (Si(OH) 4) is removed by\nthe tribochemical reaction or/and mechanical force of the\nFig. 8.

In previous\nwork,40,41we indirectly used the CeO 2tip to study its frictional\nbehavior. It is believed that studying the friction behavior of abra-\nsives with different properties at the interface is the key to quan-\ntitatively analyzing the relationship between abrasives and MRR. In\nthe next work, we will study the CMP behavior of CeO 2abrasives\nunder multi-factors through a series of experiments and FEA.\n4. Conclusions\nCeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives with different\nsurface defect concentrations were prepared by reducing\natmosphere-assisted molten salt method, which were used for CMP\nof SiO 2substrates. XRD and Rietveld re \ufb01nement con \ufb01rm that the\nCeO 2lattice shrinks due to the formation of oxygen vacancies with\nthe enhancement of the reducing atmosphere. SEM images observe\nthat the morphology of the abrasive prepared under a reducing\natmosphere gradually changes from spherical to octahedral. The\nanalysis of XPS patterns con \ufb01rms the higher concentration of de-\nfects on the surface of the abrasives prepared under a reducing\natmosphere. CMP experiments on SiO 2substrates indicate that the\nprepared abrasives all signi \ufb01cantly improve the surface quality.\nObviously, CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have very strong\npolishing ef \ufb01ciency (578.74 and 691.28 nm/min), with MRR in-\ncreases of 71.43% and 104.76%, respectively, compared to CeO 2-Air\nabrasives. The enhanced polishing ef \ufb01ciency can be attributed to\nthe elevated chemical activity (Ce3\u00feconcentration) of the CeO 2\nabrasives prepared under the reducing atmosphere, which en-\nhances the chemisorption and bonding between the CeO 2abrasives\nand the SiO 2surface. The morphology of the abrasives further af-\nfects the MRR, where the sharp edges of the abrasives enhance the\nfrictional behavior of the interface, thereby accelerating material\nremoval. In this work, the CeO 2abrasive prepared in a reducing\natmosphere has the advantages of high-speed polishing and\nimproved surface quality, which can signi \ufb01cantly improve the CMP\nperformance.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no con \ufb02ict of interest.\nAppendix A.

[DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.43.L365]\nKEYWORDS: CMP, shallow trench isolation, ceria, oxide \ufb01lm, grain size, secondary particle size, surfactant, nanotopography\nIn the shallow trench isolation (STI) process, chemical\nmechanical polishing (CMP) is applied to planarize the gap-\ufb01lling oxide \ufb01lm while utilizing a nitride \ufb01lm as a polishingstopping layer. Hence, the removal selectivity between theoxide and nitride \ufb01lms is a major speci\ufb01cation for theslurries used in STI-CMP. To improve this selectivity, ceriaslurries with ionic surfactants have been used.\n1\u20135)Both the\nsurfactant characteristics and the abrasive characteristics are\ncritical issues for STI-CMP ceria slurries. Since the ceria\nabrasive is a polycrystalline material, the grain size of theabrasive particles and the size of the particles themselvesshould be distinguished. Homma et al. investigated the\ndependence of the thermal oxide removal rate on the size ofcrystallites (=i.e., grains in a poly crystal) by changing thecalcination temperature during ceria powder fabrication.\n5)In\na previous article, we reported on the complex e\ufb00ects of the\nsize of the polycrystalline abrasives and the surfactant\nconcentration, on the basis of experiments using twodi\ufb00erent ceria powder synthesis methods.\n6)For this article,\nwe controlled the grain size and the polycrystalline abrasivesize independently by varying the calcination temperatureand the mechanical milling time, respectively. With thisexperimental approach, we investigated the e\ufb00ects of bothsizes on the \ufb01lm removal rates. In addition, we examined the\nnanotopography impact on post-CMP oxide thickness\ndeviations\n7\u201317)in order to investigate the planarization\ne\ufb03ciencies of the slurries used.15,16)\nCerium carbonate was used as a precursor to synthesize\nceria powder. The grain size of the polycrystalline ceriaabrasives was controlled by employing a calcination processat various temperatures (400, 600, 700, 800, and 900\n/C14C) for\n4 h. The abrasive particle size was controlled by a\nmechanical milling process, through which a longer milling\ntime produced a smaller abrasive. The milling time wasvaried, with durations of 8, 15, 28, and 40 h. We preparednine di\ufb00erent kinds of abrasives by combining the calcina-tion temperature and milling time as shown in Table I.\nThe ceria abrasives were dispersed in deionized water and\nstabilized by adding 100 ppm of a commercially availabledispersant (poly-meta-acrylate acid). We also added ananionic organic surfactant (poly-acrylic acid) at a concen-\ntration of 0.5 wt%. Each slurry was diluted with deionizedwater to produce a \ufb01nal ceria abrasive concentration of1 wt%. Each slurry\u2019s pH was adjusted to the range of 7.0\u20138.0by adding an alkaline agent. The morphology of theabrasives was observed with a high-resolution transmissionelectron microscope (HRTEM; JEOL JEM-2010). The\nsecondary particle size in each slurry was measured with\nan AcoustoSizer II (Colloidal Dynamics). The crystalstructure of the abrasives was examined by using thepowder X-ray method (Rigaku RINT/DMAX-2500).\nWe used conventional 8\u2019\u2019 silicon wafers prepared by the\nsingle-side polishing method. The surface nanotopographyheight\n7\u201317)was measured with a Nano-Mapper (ADE). We\ndeposited a 7000- /C23A-thick oxide and a 1500- /C23A-thick nitride\n\ufb01lm by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The \ufb01lms were\npolished on a Strasbaugh 6EC. We used an IC1000/Suba IVstacked pad (Rodel). The polishing pressure, applied as adown force, was 4 psi\u00bc27 :5 kPa . The relative velocity\nbetween the pad and the wafer was 0.539 m/s. The polishingtime was 30 s. The oxide and nitride \ufb01lm thickness variationsof the wafers before and after CMP were measured with aNano-spec 180 (Nanometrics) and a spectroscopic ellips-\nometer (MOSS-ES4G, Sopra).\nHigh-resolution TEM images of selected abrasive samples\nare shown in Fig. 1.

The modulating\ntexture observed in Fig. 1(a) is considered to be related to anamorphous phase formed as an intermediate in the decom-\nposition process of cerium carbonate during the low-\ntemperature calcination process.\n18)As these images show,\nthe grain size and morphology in the polycrystallineabrasives changed signi\ufb01cantly depending on the calcinationtemperature (Figs. 1(a), 1(c) and 1(e)). On the other hand,increasing the mechanical milling time caused minimalchange in the grain size and reduced the abrasive particlesize (Figs. 1(f), 1(h) and 1(i)).\nThe size of the grains was analyzed statistically (30 grains\nfor each condition) and then the averaged value wascalculated. However, the abrasive size was di\ufb03cult toanalyze from the TEM photographs due to the small areas ofthe images, so we used the secondary particle sizes measuredwith the AcoustoSizer II instead. These results are shown inFig. 2. With increasing calcination temperature, the grainsize increased up to 40\u201350 nm, while the secondary particle\nsize was maintained at approximately 130\u2013140 nm, as shown\nin Fig. 2(a). This phenomenon was due to grain growthduring the calcination process as atomic di\ufb00usion causedwetting of the grain boundaries of adjacent grains. The grainsize as a function of calcination temperature was in goodagreement with results reported previously.\n19)With increas-\ning mechanical milling time, the secondary particle sizedecreased from 290 to 70 nm, while the grain size was\nmaintained at approximately 40\u201350 nm, as shown in Fig.\n2(b). This occurred because the ceria powder was contin-uously fractured during the milling process.\n20)The variation\nshown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that both the grain size and theabrasive particle size were well controlled independently.\nThe removal rates of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms with respect\nto the calcination temperature and the mechanical millingtime are shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3(a) shows that the oxide\nremoval rate markedly increased from 910 to 2870 /C23A/min as\n300 nm\n300 nm400 C400 \u00b0\u2212\u00b0\u2212700 C700 900 C900 \n8 h 28 h 40 h8 h 28 h 40 h(c) (a) (e)\n(h) (f)( i)\u00b0\u2212\u00b0\u2212 \u00b0\u2212\u00b0\u2212 C C C\nFig. 1.

K ANG et al.\nthe calcination temperature increased. On the other hand, the\nnitride removal rate was maintained at approximately 50 /C23A/\nmin, which implies that the polishing mechanism of thenitride \ufb01lm is di\ufb00erent from that of the oxide \ufb01lm.\n21)Figure\n3(b) shows that the oxide removal rate decreased from 3090to 1680 /C23A/min as the mechanical milling time increased,\nwhile the nitride removal rate again was maintained atapproximately 50 /C23A/min. Although we controlled the grain\nsize and the abrasive particle size independently in this study\nby using completely di\ufb00erent methods for each factor, the\ne\ufb00ects of both sizes on the \ufb01lm removal rates appear similar.Hirai et al. proposed a model in which the polycrystalline\nceria abrasives are crushed into small particles duringpolishing.\n2)If this model is correct, then the actual size of\nthe abrasives during polishing is considered to depend onboth the grain size and the polycrystalline particle size, sincethe fractures more likely occur along grain boundaries than\nacross grains.\nFigure 4 shows X-ray di\ufb00raction pro\ufb01les of ceria\nabrasives calcined at various temperatures. The peakpatterns were identi\ufb01ed as the \ufb02uorite structure of CeO\n2.\nWith increasing calcination temperature, the peak widthdecreased, indicating that the grain size of the ceriaabrasives became larger, which corresponds to the resultsobtained by TEM, as shown in Fig. 1. We will provide a\ndetailed analysis of the X-ray di\ufb00raction pro\ufb01les and a\ncomparison with BET results in another article.\n22)\nTo analyze the e\ufb00ects of the grain size and abrasive\nparticle size on the planarization e\ufb03ciency, we examined thenanotopography impact\n15,16)on the oxide thickness deviation\n(OTD) after CMP. The polishing time was controlled tomaintain a constant removal depth of 3000 /C23A.\n17)After\ncon\ufb01rming that the peak and valley positions of the post-\nCMP OTD coincided well with those of the nanotopography\nheight (pre-CMP), the \ufb02uctuations in the post-CMP OTDwere attributed to wafer nanotopography. Figure 5 shows thestandard deviation (Rms) of the post-CMP OTD as afunction of the calcination temperature and the mechanicalmilling time. Unlike the results for the oxide removal rates,shown in Fig. 3, the calcination temperature did notin\ufb02uence the nanotopography impact, as shown in Fig.\n5(a). With increasing milling time, the nanotopography\nimpact increased, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The more the \ufb01lmsurface is planarized, the larger is the variation of post-CMPOTD due to nanotopography.\n7,15)Thus a higher standard\ndeviation, shown in Fig. 5, denotes a higher planarizatione\ufb03ciency.15,16)Therefore, it can be said that the polycrystal-\nline abrasive particle size is more important than the grainsize as a factor in controlling the planarization e\ufb03ciency of aceria slurry.\nIn summary, we independently controlled the grain size\nand particle size of the polycrystalline abrasives in a ceriaslurry with an ionic surfactant by changing the calcinationtemperature and the mechanical milling time, respectively,during abrasive synthesis. CMP experiments using slurrieswith various process combinations showed that the oxideremoval rate increased with both the grain size and theabrasive particle size, while the nitride removal rate was\nindependent of both. On the other hand, examination of the\nnanotopography impact showed that the planarizatione\ufb03ciency increased as the particle size decreased but wasindependent of the grain size.\nThis work was supported by the Korea Ministry of\nScience & Technology through the National ResearchLaboratory (NRL) program, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. andSumitomo Mitsubishi Silicon Corp.

Introduction\nChemical  Mechanical  Polishing  (CMP)  processes  are  being  uti-\nlized  to  achieve  global  planarization  of  substrates  with  surface\ncoatings  of  varying  thickness  ranging  from  nanometres  to  several\nmicrometres,  with  desired  selectivity  and  minimum  defects  [1\u20133] .\nInitially,  CMP  was  majorly  used  for  planarization  of  silicon  sub-\nstrates  but  has  also  subsequently  found  application  in  polishing\nsemiconductors,  metals  and  polymer  surfaces  for  technologies  like\nintegrated  circuit  (IC)  manufacturing  and  micro-electromechanical\nsystems  (MEMS)  [2].  In  CMP,  both  chemical  and  mechanical  prop-\nerties  of  the  abrasive  particles  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  high\npolishing  rates.  The  chemical  nature,  size  and  shape  of  the  abrasive\nparticles  used  in  polishing  slurry  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  the\ndesired  CMP  results.  Silica  particles  have  been  used  extensively  as\nan  abrasive  in  polishing  industry.  Recently  ceria  has  also  been  used\nas  an  abrasive  because  of  its  high  chemical  selectivity,  in  compari-\nson  to  silica  [4\u20136] .\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nE-mail address:  pbhargava@iitb.ac.in  (P.  Bhargava).Employment  of  technologies  like  shallow  trench  isolation  (STI),\nwhich  isolates  neighbouring  semiconductor  devices  in  an  IC  cir-\ncuit,  critically  depends  on  the  planarization  capacity  of  CMP  process\n[15,16] .  In  STI  the  CMP  process  is  used  to  polish  off  the  SiO 2dielec-\ntric  layer,  down  to  the  underlying  nitride,  and  stops  at  the  nitride\nlayer.  STI  heavily  depends  on  CMP  for  selective  removal  of  SiO 2\nover  SiN  layer.  Towards  this  end,  CMP  slurry  must  have  high  selec-\ntivity  to  oxide  with  respect  to  the  nitride,  and  should  leave  the\nsurface,  planar  and  defect-free  [5].  Cook  et  al.  estimated  that  one\nSiO 2molecule  is  removed  for  every  twenty-four  collisions  between\nceria  abrasive  and  silica  substrate  compare  to  500  million  collisions\nrequired  in  the  case  of  silica  abrasive.  Ceria  slurries,  selective  pol-\nishing  of  silicon  oxide  over  silicon  nitride  \ufb01lms  and  higher  removal\nrates  is  explained  based  on  ceria\u2019s  inherently  superior  chemical\nselectivity  and  higher  polishing  rates,  compared  to  silica  abrasive\nparticles  [5,6,17\u201319] .\nIn  CMP,  mono-dispersity  and  morphology  of  abrasive  particles\nare  identi\ufb01ed  as  important  factors  which  affect  the  polishing  rates\n[5\u201311,14] .  Some  of  the  signi\ufb01cant  and  cost  effective  methods  for\nsynthesis of  abrasive  particles  including  ceria  are  solvo-thermal\nmethod,  sol\u2013gel  method,  self-assembly,  electrochemical  method\nand  micro-emulsion  method  [4].  However,  mono-dispersity  and\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.09.149\n0169-4332/\u00a9 2015  Elsevier  B.V.  All  rights  reserved.\nL.

Ceria\ncoated silica nanoparticle  structures  are  identi\ufb01ed  as  a  successful\napproach  for  controlling  the  size  and  morphology  of  ceria  abrasive\nparticles  [8,20\u201324] .  In  this  study  we  investigate  synthesis  of  less\nthan  100  nm  pseudo  ceria  particles  by  undertaking  coating  of  \ufb01ne\nceria  particles  over  coarser  silica.\nSynthesis  of  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticle  enables  modulating\nselectivity of the  CMP  process  to  tap  into  potential  Shallow  Trench\nIsolation  (STI)  market  [25,26] .  The  presently  available/reported  lit-\nerature and information,  on  properties  of  ceria  in  CMP  is  minimal.\nThis  paper  demonstrates  the  synthesis  and  study  of  various  param-\neters  in\ufb02uencing  the  formation  of  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles\nof  size  less  than  100  nm.  CMP  abrasive  slurries  prepared  using  syn-\nthesized  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  were  used  for  studying\nSiO 2:SiN  polishing  selectivity.\n2.  Experimental\n2.1.  Preparation  of  bare-silica  nanoparticles\nA popular  and  widely  reported  method  for  silica  nanoparti-\ncle  synthesis  is  Stober  method  [27] .  In  Stober  process,  silicon\nalkoxides  are  hydrolysed  to  silanols,  which  further  undergoes  con-\ndensation  reaction  to  form  silica  nanoparticles.  There  are  various\nmodi\ufb01cations  of  this  method  reported  in  the  literature  [27,28] .\nBoth  sol\u2013gel  and  microemulsion  routes  were  used  to  synthesize\nmono-dispersed  and  spherical  silica  nanoparticles  of  size  less  than\n100  nm.  It  was  observed  that  for  particles  less  than  100  nm,  using\nsol\u2013gel  method,  it  was  dif\ufb01cult  to  control  size  and  shape  of  the  silica\nnano  particles.  The  resulting  nanoparticles  were  highly  agglomer-\nated with  necking  between  the  individual  nanoparticles  as  shown\nin  Fig.  1(a)  and  (c).  On  the  other  hand,  using  microemulsion  methodthe particle size  and  shape  were  controllable.  The  well  separated\nnanoparticles  are  shown  in  Fig.  1(b)  and  (d).  In  microemulsion\nmethod, the surfactant  molecules  dissolved  in  organic  solvents\nforming  spherical  micelles.  Silica  nanoparticles  are  grown,  inside\nthese  micellar  micro-cavities,  by  controlled  addition  of  silicon\nalkoxides  and  catalyst  [29,30] .  Fig.  1  shows  a  comparison  of  par-\nticles  synthesized  using  sol\u2013gel  and  micro-emulsion  methods.\nIn  micro-emulsion  method  tetraethyl  orthosilicate  (TEOS)  was\nused as a  source  of  silica,  Triton  X-100  was  used  as  surfactant,\ncyclohexane  was  the  organic  phase  and  hexanol  was  used  as  co-\nsurfactant [29] .  Addition  of  a  co-surfactant  further  stabilizes  the\nmicroemulsion  system  as  it  bridges  the  oil  and  water  interface.\n25%  NH 4OH  was  used  as  a  catalyst  for  the  reaction.  For  the  syn-\nthesis,  DI  water  and  ammonia  was  added  to  a  mixture  of  Triton\nX-100  and  cyclohexane  in  hexanol  under  sonication  followed  by\ndrop  wise  addition  of  TEOS.  The  reactants  were  mixed  for  24  h  dur-\ning  which  TEOS  was  hydrolysed  by  NH 4OH  to  obtain  silica  particles.\nThe  use  of  surfactant  helps  in  stabilizing  the  emulsion  and  controls\nthe  morphology  of  the  silica  particles  formed.  Upon  completion\nof  reaction,  ethanol  was  added  to  the  reaction  mixture  to  break\nthe  micro-emulsion  and  release  silica  nanoparticles.  Further  these\nSiO 2nanoparticles  were  separated  using  centrifugation  method.\nCollected particles  were  washed  twice  with  ethanol  and  DI  water.\nThese  particles  were  heated  at  250\u25e6C  for  4  h  to  remove  the  surfac-\ntant  molecules  from  the  surface  before  they  were  further  used  for\nceria  coating.\n2.2. Preparation  of  ceria  coated  silica  particles\nMono-dispersed  silica  nanoparticles  synthesized  using  micro-\nemulsion  methods  were  used  as  a  core  particle  for  further  coating\nwith CeO 2particles.

Cerium  nitrate  solution  was\nadded to  the  above  dispersion  under  continuous  stirring  followed\nby drop wise  addition  of  NH 4OH  solution.  Stirring  was  continued\nbeyond  completion  of  NH 4OH  addition  for  the  next  12  h  for  the\nreaction to keep  progressing.  In  order  to  achieve  complete  coating\nof  ceria  over  silica  core  particles  the  pH  (4\u201310)  and  temperature\n(50\u25e6C\u201395\u25e6C)  of  the  ceria  precipitation  reaction  was  varied.  Ceria\ncoated  silica  nanoparticles  were  separated  by  centrifugation\nfollowed by washing  repeatedly  with  de-ionized  water  to  remove\nany  possible  ionic  remnants.\n2.3.  Polishing  experiments\nPolishing  tests  were  carried  out  on  Ecomet  4+  Automet  pol-\nishing  machine  manufactured  by  Buehler  using  groove  pads  made\nof  polyurethane.  The  rotation  speed  of  the  pad  was  set  at  80  rpm\nwith  an  applied  downward  load  of  15  lbs  and  a  constant  slurry\n\ufb02ow  rate  of  100  ml/min  was  maintained.  The  polishing  slurries\nwere  prepared  by  dispersing  silica  nanoparticles,  ceria  nanopar-\nticles  and  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  separately  in  aqueous\nmedium with  additives  and  was  mixed  on  a  roller  miller.  Film\nthickness  reduction  of  polished  Si  wafers  was  determined  using  an\noptical  ellipsometer  (JOBIN-YVON  SPEX).  Structural  analysis  of  the\nceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  was  carried  out  using  TEM  (Philips\nCM  200  keV)  and  it  was  compared  to  particles  used  in  prepara-\ntion  of  commercial  slurries.  X-ray  diffractometer  (XRD;  Bruker\nD8-advance,  Karlsruhe,  Germany)  was  used  to  carry  out  the  phase\nanalysis  of  the  nanoparticles.  Synthesized  particles  were  charac-\nterized  by  FTIR  to  study  the  coating  and  surface  functional  groups.\nSurface  charge  of  these  particles  was  analyzed  using  zeta  potential\nmeasurements.3. Results and discussions\n3.1. Properties  of  silica  and  ceria  coated  silica  particles\nFig.  2(a)  shows  TEM  image  of  silica  particles  separated  from\ncommercial  CMP  slurry,  and  is  used  for  comparison  in  this\nstudy.  Fig.  2(b)  shows  spherical  and  mono-dispersed  silica  par-\nticles  synthesized  through  micro-emulsion  method.  The  size  and\nshape  of  silica  nanoparticles  was  controlled  by  the  size  and\nshape  of  micro-droplets  of  emulsion  by  varying  the  NH 4OH  con-\ncentration and use  of  co-surfactant  hexanol.  Fig.  2(c)  and  (d)\nshows  TEM  images  of  ceria  particles  extracted  from  a  commercial\nslurry  and  ceria  particles  synthesized  using  precipitation  method\nrespectively.\nDuring precipitation  reaction  of  ceria  on  silica  particles,  pH  and\ntemperatures  was  varied,  to  obtain  different  extents  of  ceria  coat-\ning  on  silica.  The  precipitation  of  ceria  from  cerium  nitrate  depends\non  the  reaction  pH.  Beyond  pH  6,  the  nitrates  undergo  an  exchange\nreaction  with  hydroxyl  ion  as  shown  in  Eq.  (1).  pH  of  the  precipi-\ntation  reaction  was  controlled,  by  varying  the  amount  of  NH 4OH,\nand  it  was  observed  that  at  a  lower,  acidic  pH  (3\u20135),  ceria  forms  a\npartial  coating  on  silica  at  room  temperature  as  shown  in  Fig.  3(a).\nFor  acidic  pH,  increasing  the  reaction  temperature  from  room  tem-\nperature  to  95\u25e6C  also  resulted  in  partial  coating  of  ceria  on  silica\nparticles  as  in  Fig.  3(b).\nCe  \u2212  O  \u2212  NO 2+  OH\u2212\u2192  Ce  \u2212  OH  +  NO 3\u2212(1)\nFull coating  of  silica  particles  by  ceria  nanoparticles  as  shown\nin  Fig.  3(c)  and  (d)  was  achieved  by  increasing  the  pH  of  precipita-\ntion  reaction  to  a  basic  pH  >  10  and  reaction  temperature  of  95\u25e6C.\nThis  can  be  explained  based  on  the  electrostatic  attraction  between\nionic precursor  of  ceria  and  surface  charge  on  silica  particles.  At\na  basic  pH,  the  surface  of  silica  particles  acquire  negative  charge\nL. Peedikakkandy  et  al.  /  Applied  Surface  Science  357  (2015)  1306\u20131312  1309\nFig. 3.

Polishing  of  SiO 2and  SiN  wafers\nPolishing  experiments  were  carried  out  on  thermally  grown\nsilicon  oxide  and  nitride  \ufb01lms  on  silicon  wafers  (Noel  Technolo-\ngies,  Campbell,  CA)  and  were  polished  on  a  Buehler  Phoenix-beta\npolisher  using  IC-1400K  Groove  pads  made  of  polyurethane  (Rodel\nInc.,  Phoenix,  AZ).  Before  each  experiment,  the  polishing  pad  was\nconditioned  for  1  min  with  a  diamond  grit  conditioner  using  de-\nionized  water.  The  aqueous  polishing  slurry  (1  wt%)  was  sonicated\nfor  30  min  and  was  placed  on  a  roller  miller  to  maintain  good\ndispersion.  The  pH  of  slurry  before  polishing  was  measured  and\nmaintained  at  pH-5  at  which  the  silicon  oxide  wafer  and  the  ceria\nparticles  will  be  oppositely  charged  and  thus  improving  interac-\ntion  between  wafers  and  particles.  For  pH  >  5  the  particle  settling\nrate  was  found  to  be  higher  and  ceria  coated  silica  slurry  was  found\nto  be  unstable  at  basic  pH.  This  observation  is  similar  to  that  of\nbare  ceria  particle  slurry  showing  increased  particle  agglomeration\nand  reduced removal rates  and  stability  for  ceria  slurry  at  basic  pH\n(pH  >  7)  [1,11] .\nThe polishing rates  for  SiO 2and  SiN  wafers  were  determined\nfrom  the  differences  of  the  \ufb01lm  thicknesses  measured  by  ellipsome-\ntry technique [13] .  Selective  polishing  ratio  of  12  was  observed  for\nSiO 2:SiN  wafers  using  ceria  coated  silica  particles  prepared  under\ndifferent conditions. The  polishing  mechanism  is  explained  as  fol-\nlows.  When  ceria  abrasive  particles  come  in  contact  with  the  silica\nsurface,  a  chemical  bond  forms  between  the  ceria  particle  and  sil-\nica  surface  as  shown  in  Eq.  (2).  Further,  strained  Ce\u2013O\u2013Si  bond\nruptures  at  the  weaker  Si\u2013O  bond  due  to  the  mechanical  motion\nduring  CMP  and  is  removed  as  silicic  acid  (Si(OH) 4)  in  aqueous\nslurry.\nSiO\u2212+  Ce  \u2212  OH  \u2192  Ce  \u2212  O  \u2212Si  +  +OH\u2212(2)\nA study  of  particles  collected  from  used  slurries  after  the  polish-\ning experiments revealed that  ceria  coated  over  silica  at  pH  10  and\n95\u25e6C  reaction  temperature  had  better  adherence  with  core-silica.\nThis is indicated  by  almost  no  change  in  XRD  peaks  and  structure\nobserved  under  TEM  as  shown  in  Fig.  8.

It  was  observed  that  for  particles  prepared  at  pH  4.5,\nceria coating was  removed  from  the  silica  surface  after  the  polish-\ning  experiment.  Whereas  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  prepared\nat  pH  10  before  polishing  as  shown  in  Fig.  8(c)  and  after  polish-\ning  as  shown  in  Fig.  8(d)  show  better  adherence  of  ceria  on  silica\ncore.\n4.  Conclusions\nThis  study  demonstrates  synthesis  of  highly  spherical  and\nmono-dispersed, ceria coated  silica  nanoparticles  for  application\nas  abrasive  particles  in  selective  CMP.  Coating  of  ceria  over  sil-\nica  was  done  using  precipitation  method.  Precipitation  reactions\nwere  carried  out  by  varying  the  pH  and  reaction  temperature.  A\nuniform  and  adherent  coating  of  ceria  over  silica  was  obtained  for\nreaction  carried  out  at  95\u25e6C  at  pH  10.  Coating  of  ceria  over  sil-\nica  and  dispersion  properties  were  studied  using  TEM,  EDX,  XRD\nand  zeta-potential  analyses,  and  the  results  show  formation  of\nstable  and  dispersed  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  of  size  less\nthan  100  nm.  These  uniform  and  spherical  nanoparticles  structures\nare  excellent  substitutes  for  coarser  ceria  abrasive  particles.  When\nused  as  an  abrasive  material  in  polishing  slurry,  these  less  than\n100  nm  nanoparticles  particles  considerably  reduce  the  solid  load-\ning  in  the  formulated  CMP  slurry.  Polishing  results  achieved  so  far\nshows  improvement  in  selectivity  between  SiO 2and  SiN  wafers\nusing 1  wt%  nanoparticles  particle  slurry  with  maximum  selective\nremoval  rate  of  12.Acknowledgements\nThis work  was  supported  by  Applied  Materials  Inc.  through  the\nAnnual  Sponsored  Projects  Program.

[DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.45.4893 ]\nKEYWORDS: calcination, density, particle size distribution, agglomeration, ceria, slurry, STI CMP\n1. Introduction\nThe shallow trench isolation (STI) process is one of the\nmost crucial applications of chemical mechanical planariza-tion (CMP) technologies. It has replaced the local oxidationof silicon (LOCOS) method, providing a high degree ofplanarity necessary to meet stringent photolithography\nrequirements. In STI CMP, the selectivity between oxide\nand nitride layers is a critical factor determining the STIprocess margin and product yield.\n1\u20134)At the same time, a\nhigh oxide removal rate is necessary for a high productione\ufb03ciency. Recently, therefore, ceria slurry has been widelyused in STI CMP.\n5)Ceria slurry, however, has a major\ndisadvantage in that it produces many kinds of defect,including micro scratches, caused by large grains and\nagglomerated particles.\n6\u201310)Therefore, to improve STI\nCMP using ceria slurry, it is necessary to minimize theproduction of large grains and agglomeration of particles,while maintaining a high oxide removal rate and goodselectivity.\nRecently, the physical properties of ceria particles and\ntheir polishing mechanism have been investigated.\n11)Few\nstudies, however, have examined the e\ufb00ect of the calcination\nof cerium carbonate, which is used as a precursor for ceria\nparticles, on STI CMP performance, even though thecalcination process determines important characteristics ofboth ceria particles and slurry. The degree of synthesisa\ufb00ects removal rate and selectivity. The size distribution ofceria particles and their agglomeration behavior greatlyin\ufb02uence the remaining particles and micro scratch count onoxide \ufb01lms. In this study, therefore, we analyzed the\ncharacteristics of two kinds of ceria particle manufactured\nby di\ufb00erent calcination processes, namely, the conventionalone-step calcination and a two-step calcination consisting ofdecarbonation and crystal growth. In addition, STI CMPperformance was compared between the two processes.\n2. Experimental Procedure\nIn this study, two kinds of ceria particle were synthesized\nfrom a starting material of high-purity cerium carbonate bythe solid-state displacement reaction method. The calcina-\ntion generated a yellowish-white ceria powder. One kind ofceria powder, denoted as sample A, was calcined by theconventional one-step calcination method while the other,sample B, was calcined by the two-step calcination method.In the case of one-step calcination, the carbonate precursorwas calcined at 700\n/C14C for 4 h only once. In two-step\ncalcination, on the other hand, ceria particles were obtained\nafter a second step of calcination at 650/C14C for 4 h, after the\ninitial calcination at 650/C14C for 4 h. In addition, between the\n\ufb01rst and second steps of calcination, ceria particles werepulverized with a dry mechanical crusher called the air jetmill. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show ceria particles before andafter the dry mechanical crushing, respectively. That is,sample B was calcined for a longer period and at a lower\ntemperature than sample A. Furthermore, ceria particles of\nsample B were well calcined even at the center ofagglomerated large particle shown in Fig. 1(a) by the secondstep of calcination carried out after the dry mechanicalcrushing, while those of sample A were not, since the corepart of agglomerated particles was pulled apart during thedry pulverization. After the calcination of samples A and B,ceria powders were pulverized by wet mechanical milling\nfor 6 h to reduce their secondary particle size to the target\nsize of 250 nm, and to disperse the particles in an aqueousmedium after mixing them with de-ionized water andcommercially available anionic acrylic polymers as adispersant.\nThe average crystallite size of ceria particles was\nmeasured by X-ray di\ufb00raction (XRD; RINT/DMAX-2500,Rigaku, Japan), with calculation using the Debye\u2013Scherer\nequation. The density of the powder was measured with a\npycnometer (Accupyc 1330, Micromeritics, U.S.A.), andporosity was calculated from density data using the follow-ing equation:\nPorosity \u00bc\u00bd \u00f0N\nt/C0Nm\u00de=Nt/C138/C2100 ;\nwhere NtandNmdenote the theoretical density and the\nmeasured density, respectively. The theoretical density of\nceria particles was taken as 7.2 g/cm3. The size of individual\ngrains was also observed by transmission electron microsco-py (TEM; JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan).

The thicknesses of the as-deposited oxide andnitride \ufb01lms were 7000 and 1500 A \u02da, respectively. A CMP\nmachine for 8 in. wafers (6EC, Strasbaugh, U.S.A.) with agrooved IC1000/Suba IV pad (Rodel, USA) was used. The\nrotation speeds of the head and the table were both 70 rpm,\nthe relative velocity between the pad and wafer was 250 fpm(feet per min), and the slurry \ufb02ow rate was 100 cm\n3/min. Tocalculate removal rate, \ufb01lm thickness was measured with\nNanospec 180 (Nano-metrics, U.S.A.). The number ofremaining particles larger than 0.2\nmmwas determined using\nthe stationary beam technology and optional bright \ufb01eldchannel of a Surfscan SP1 (KLA-Tencor, U.S.A.).\n3. Results and Discussion\nAs shown in Fig. 2, sample B showed better CMP\nperformance, including a higher oxide removal rate, betterselectivity, and fewer remaining particles on the oxide \ufb01lm.Since the slurry containing more remaining particles usuallycauses more microscratches, it can be expected thatsample A has more microscratches.\n10,13)These results are\nsummarized in Table I. Oxide removal rate usually depends\non particle sizes, namely, grain size and secondary particle\nsize. As these particle sizes increase, oxide removal rate alsoincreases, while nitride removal rate remains almost thesame if the concentration of the additive is above a criticalpoint.\n14\u201316)However, the average grain size calculated from\nXRD data and the secondary particle size measured by theconventional light scattering method with ultrasonic treat-ment were similar for samples A and B, indicating no size\ne\ufb00ect on removal rate, as shown in Table II. There was a\ndi\ufb00erence, on the other hand, in the density and porosity ofceria particles. As summarized in Table III, the density of(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1.

K IMet al.\n4894\nsample B was higher than that of sample A, while porosity\nexhibited the opposite tendency. This means that ceriaparticles of sample B were denser and harder (less porous)owing to the higher degree of synthesis than those of\nsample A, resulting in a higher oxide removal rate. More-over, the nitride removal rates were very similar, whichmeans better selectivity for sample B than for sample A. InSTI CMP, ceria particles penetrate the viscous layer on theoxide or nitride \ufb01lm, react with the hydrated surface to form\ncovalent bonds such as Ce\u2013O\u2013Si, and then detach lumps of\noxide and nitride.\n17)The viscous layer on the nitride \ufb01lm,\nhowever, is too thick for a di\ufb00erence in the degree ofsynthesis to be detected in terms of nitride removal rate.\n18,19)\nTo determine the reason for the di\ufb00erence in the count ofTable I.

Sample A contained both large andsmall grains, while sample B was composed of uniformlydistributed and medium-sized particles. The size distributionof 20 particles randomly selected from the TEM images is\nshown in Fig. 3(c). As con\ufb01rmed by the TEM images,\nsample A had a wider size distribution than sample B. Inparticular, the large grains of sample A led to defects,including remaining particles. In addition, the agglomerationbehavior of sample slurries was measured using a particlesize analyzer, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table II. The di\ufb00er-ence in particle size between the measurements with andwithout ultrasonic treatment was much larger for sample A\nthan for sample B, indicating that sample A had greater\nagglomeration. This was attributed to the broad sizedistribution of small and large particles in sample A, asshown in TEM images. Small particles with large surfaceareas aggregate around large particles so as to reduce thetotal surface energy, thus promoting agglomeration.\n20)\nThese di\ufb00erences between samples A and B in terms of\ndensity, porosity and grain size distribution, which led to\ndi\ufb00erences in STI CMP performance, were attributed to the\ndi\ufb00erence in the two calcination processes, in which ceriumcarbonate reacts with oxygen via the following reaction:\n21)CeCO 3OH\u00fe1/4 O 2!CeO 2\u00feCO 2\u00fe1/2 H 2O:\nAccording to Kosynkin et al. , the oxidation reaction of the\ncarbonate precursor, consisting of decarbonation and crystalgrowth, is not always completed at a speci\ufb01c temperaturerange, and the e\ufb03ciency of decarbonation of the carbonate\nprecursor and that of the crystal growth of ceria particles are\ndi\ufb00erent in terms of the temperature range.\n22)In a lower\ntemperature range between 400 and 500/C14C, the e\ufb03ciency of\ndecarbonation is high, while the crystal growth rate is low.In a higher temperature range between 700 and 800\n/C14C,\nhowever, the relationship between decarbonation e\ufb03ciencyand crystal growth rate is reversed, namely, slow decarbon-ation and fast crystal growth.\n22)Therefore, during calcina-\ntion at the low-temperature range, density increases rapidly\nwhile grain size increases slowly, since most of the energy isused not for crystal growth but for decarbonation. During thecalcination at high temperature range, on the other hand, thegrain size increases rapidly, since the grains combine witheach other to stabilize themselves by reducing the totalsurface energy. Figure 5(a) shows these variations, asrepresented through a comparison between the increase in\ndensity per unit increase in grain size and the increase in\ngrain size per unit increase in density at various temper-atures.

K IMet al.\n4896\nhigh temperature, had more large grains than sample B, and\nthe density of sample A was lower than that of sample B,\nwhich was calcined for a long period at a low temperature.\nIn addition, the core part of large agglomerated particles\nshown in Fig. 1(a) reacts more slowly than the outer part ofparticles and thus cannot be calcined completely. Thisphenomenon is due to both a low supply of reactant oxygenand di\ufb03culty in removing the carbon dioxide product. Thelarge agglomeration of particles results in the large mass-transfer resistance of gases, which prevents those gases from\ndi\ufb00using inside or outside of agglomerated particles.\n23,24)\nTherefore, as con\ufb01rmed in the above equation of calcination\nreaction, such a slow di\ufb00usion and mass transfer of gasesretard the calcination reaction, resulting in small grains inthe core part. In the case of sample B, however, the core partcan also be well calcined since the dry mechanical crushingbefore the second step of calcination pulls the core part outof agglomerated particles. Such complete calcination re-\nmoves small grains observed in sample A, which was\nprepared by the one-step calcination method. Moreover, inthe second step of calcination, the size of small grainsincreased much faster than that of large grains. As shown inFig. 5(b), when ceria powders processed with the \ufb01rst step ofcalcination at 400, 500, and 600\n/C14C, and calcined with the\nsecond step at 700/C14C, the \ufb01nal grain sizes calculated from\nthe XRD data for the three samples were very similar at 25\u2013\n26 nm. This happened even though the grain sizes after the\n\ufb01rst step were di\ufb00erent, namely, 8.1 nm (400/C14C), 11.5 nm\n(500/C14C), and 17.2 nm (600/C14C). Therefore, the additional\ncrystal growth of large grains was restricted in the secondstep of calcination, even though active crystal growth ofsmall grains occurred, resulting in narrow grain sizedistribution.\n4. Conclusions\nIn this study, we have demonstrated that the two-step\ncalcination method, in which ceria particles were wellcalcined to the core part of agglomerated precursorcarbonate at low temperature for a long period, leads toceria particles with a high density, a low porosity and anarrow size distribution, as observed in the case ofsample B. By using the two-step calcination method, it is\nthus possible to generate dense particles with a higher degree\nof synthesis, without large grains causing micro-scratchesand small grains triggering the agglomeration of colloidalparticles. By using ceria particles calcined by the two-stepmethod, we can improve STI CMP performance, with ahigher oxide removal rate, a higher oxide-to-nitride selec-tivity, and fewer defects.Acknowledgement\nThe Korea Ministry of Science and Technology supported\nthis work through the National Research Laboratory (NRL)program.

The ceria particles were synthesized via a solid-state displacement reaction method, and their crystalline structure was\ncontrolled by regulating the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction site on the precursor. In a calcination process with a high\noxygen concentration, the synthesized ceria particles had a cubic \ufb02uorite structure /H20849CeO\n2/H20850because of the decarbonation of the\ncerium precursor at a high oxygen partial pressure. The particles calcined with a low oxygen partial pressure had an included\nhexagonal structure /H20849Ce2O3/H20850. The ceria slurry prepared with the cubic CeO2yielded a higher removal rate than the slurry prepared\nwith the hexagonal Ce2O3. Furthermore, the ceria slurry with the cubic structured particles had less residual particles on the oxide\n\ufb01lm than the slurry with the hexagonal structured particles. The resulting residual particles originated because Ce2O3is easily\nagglomerated and adsorbed on the wafer surface due to the high surface activity resulting from the oxygen vacancy on the particlesurface.\u00a9 2007 The Electrochemical Society. /H20851DOI: 10.1149/1.2735923 /H20852All rights reserved.\nManuscript submitted April 26, 2006; revised manuscript received January 8, 2007. Available electronically May 22, 2007.\nIn the manufacture of next-generation LSI devices, chemical me-\nchanical planarization /H20849CMP /H20850is a key process used for the pla-\nnarization of wafer surfaces to achieve a multilevelinterconnection.1-3A wide range of global planarization is required\nto attain a suf\ufb01cient depth of focus /H20849DOF /H20850within the process margin\nof exposure equipment for the \ufb01ne process technology patterns. Inthe CMP process, slurry conditions are critical for the realization ofhigh-quality wafer devices due to the chemical and mechanical in-teractions with the deposited \ufb01lm surface. The required dimensions\nof current semiconductor devices are decreasing below 50 nm. Be-\ncause of this, a ceria-based slurry is widely used instead of otherabrasive slurries in shallow trench isolation /H20849STI /H20850as well as inter-\nlayer dielectric /H20849ILD /H20850CMP for the manufacture of dynamic random\naccess memory /H20849DRAM /H20850and \ufb02ash memory devices, due to the good\nremoval selectivity, chip uniformity, global planarity, and the highpolishing ef\ufb01ciency of the oxide \ufb01lm.\n4However, the ceria slurry\ninduces defects on the wafer surface because of the large, abrasiveagglomerated particles resulting from poor dispersion stability. Dur-ing CMP, the agglomerated particles easily stick to the wafer sur-face, which results in residual particles and scratches on the wafersurface.\n5-9In order to reduce the surface defects, particle agglom-\neration should be prevented by the stabilization of the ceriasuspension.10-12In general, the dispersion stability can be improved\nby adding an adequate polymeric dispersant. However, the stabiliza-tion of the ceria suspension using a polymeric dispersant has limi-tations in successfully eliminating the agglomerated particles whichcan induce scratches on the wafer surface. Therefore, a new methodwhich can prevent the agglomeration of the ceria particle must beproposed. In this study, we considered the intrinsic properties of theparticles themselves as a critical factor to prevent agglomeration andadhesion on the wafer, and thus, an attempt to control the intrinsicproperties of the ceria powder was made. Ceria powder has beensynthesized by many different methods including wet precipitation,sol-gel, hydrothermal, mechanochemical, and solid-state displace-ment reactions /H20849calcinations /H20850.\n4,13The solid-state displacement reac-\ntion is widely used for the synthesis of ceria particles because thecrystallite size of the particles can be easily controlled by varyingthe calcination conditions such as temperature, time, and oxygenvapor pressure.\n14,15The removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lm is propor-\ntional to the crystallite size of the ceria particles.15The large crys-\ntallite size of the particles results from a high calcination tempera-ture and easily induces many scratches on the wafer surface. Thus,the synthesis of ceria particles at low temperatures is favorable inthe CMP process. During the calcination, the by-product carbon\ndioxide is present around the precursor powder and this causes dif-fusion resistance for oxygen at the reaction site.\n16It induces an\noxygen vacancy within the ceria crystal lattice, which can result invariations of crystal structure. Therefore, in the low-temperature cal-cination process, the oxygen concentration in the furnace plays animportant role in the synthesis reaction because of the accelerationof the decarbonation of the cerium precursor.\nIn this study, the crystal structure of the ceria particles was con-\ntrolled by varying the oxygen concentration. The in\ufb02uence of thecrystalline structure of the ceria particles on both particle agglom-eration in the slurry and residual particles onto the oxide \ufb01lm afterCMP was investigated.\nExperimental\nHigh-purity cerium carbonate hydrate /H20851Ce/H20849CO\n3/H208503, Juntai, China /H20852\nwas employed as a starting material for the solid-state displacement\nreaction of the ceria particles. The precursor was calcined under air\nat 650\u00b0C for 4 h, which resulted in a white-yellowish ceria powder.\nIn order to prepare two different crystal structures, the oxygen con-centration was controlled by adjusting the air in\ufb02ow. The particles of\nsamples A and B were synthesized with air \ufb02ows of 35 and 5 m\n3/h,\nrespectively, and the particles of sample C were synthesized withoutair \ufb02ow. The crystallite size of the ceria particles was measured bythe X-ray diffraction method /H20849RINT/DMAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan /H20850\nand calculated using the Debye\u2013Scherer equation. The speci\ufb01c sur-face areas of the powders were estimated utilizing the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller /H20849BET /H20850method /H20849ASAP 2010, Micromeritics, USA /H20850.\nBy using nitrogen gas, the samples were outgassed at 250\u00b0C for 2 h\nprior to each analysis to remove physisorbed species from the pow-der surface. Each calcined ceria powder underwent a wet-mechanical milling process for several hours to reduce the particle\nsize to the target size /H20849240\u2013260 nm as determined by a conventional\nlight-scattering method /H20850and to disperse the particles in an aqueous\nmedium after mixing the powder with deionized water and a dis-persant composed of commercially available anionic acrylic poly-mers /H20851poly /H20849methyl methacrylate /H20850, PMAA /H20852. The solid content of the\nslurry was controlled to a weight fraction of 5%, and the suspensionpH was adjusted to 8.4. After preparing the ceria slurry, two sampleswere dried to investigate the crystallite size and speci\ufb01c surfacearea. For each sample, the crystallite size and surface area are listedin Table I.\nThe diffraction patterns of the particles were also investigated\nusing high-resolution TEM /H20849JEOL2010, Jeol, Japan /H20850to certify the\ncrystalline structure and morphology of the ceria particles.

The particle size distributions were found to benoticeably different between samples based on the TEM images.\nThe portion of small-sized particles /H20849/H1102120 nm /H20850in samples B and C\nwas larger than in sample A. The initial crystallite size of all as-\ncalcined samples calculated by the Debye\u2013Scherer equation was\nabout 26 nm. However, the crystallite sizes of the particles aftermechanical milling became 25, 21.5, and 20.3 nm for samples A, B,\nand C, respectively, which leads to a signi\ufb01cantly different speci\ufb01csurface area for each particle group. After mechanical milling, theparticles in all samples had similar size, ranging from 240 to\n260 nm. Therefore, the particles /H20849samples B and C /H20850which were\ncalcined at low oxygen concentration are composed of a large num-\nber of small crystallites /H2084920.3 and 21.5 nm /H20850, while the particles\n/H20849sample A /H20850which were calcined at a higher oxygen concentration\nwere composed of relatively larger crystallites /H2084925 nm /H20850.\nWith the high-resolution TEM nanobeam diffraction pattern, the\ncrystalline structures of the ceria particles were investigated.

The calcination process from cerium carbon-ate to cerium oxide consists of a \ufb01ve-step mechanism and includesthe mass-transfer of the reacting agent /H20849oxygen /H20850from the bulk at-\nmosphere to the periphery of carbonate, its diffusion through thepore channels of the carbonate, adsorption, reaction with the cerium\ncarbonate, and the desorption of the reaction by-product /H20849carbon\ndioxide /H20850.\n16In this reaction mechanism, several factors in\ufb02uence the\nphysical properties of the synthesized particles during the calcina-tion process. According to previous reports, a low oxygen concen-tration results in a hexagonal phase cerium oxide rather than the\ncubic phase due to the insuf\ufb01cient oxidation of Ce\n3+to Ce4+.17In\nthe absence of an external oxygen supply, the hexagonal CeO xphase\nis reported to be observed between 400 and 500\u00b0C and the oxidationof CeO\nxis complete above 800\u00b0C, which results in the transforma-\ntion from hexagonal Ce 2O3to cubic CeO 2.18Therefore, the hexago-\nnal phase /H20849Ce2O3/H20850in samples B and C was formed due to the in-\nsuf\ufb01cient oxidation of Ce3+to Ce4+, while the cubic phase /H20849CeO 2/H20850in\nsample A was obtained due to suf\ufb01cient oxygen supply.\nTo investigate agglomeration in the slurries, we measured the\nnumber of large particles /H20849/H110221/H9262m/H20850per unit volume by using a\nslurry particle counter and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Samples\nB and C with a hexagonal crystalline structure have more larger\nagglomerated particles than sample A. Because the Ce3+and oxygen\nvacancies in the surface of the hexagonal ceria particle are linked toanionic vacancies with hydroxyl groups, chemisorption and agglom-eration easily occurred with the neighboring cation-species andbared ceria surface.\n18,19Moreover, samples B and C have many\nsmall particles, which were con\ufb01rmed to have a mainly hexagonalcrystalline structure /H20849Fig. 3 /H20850. The van der Waals attractive force is\nwell known to increase with decreasing particle size; therefore, thelarge agglomerated particles in samples B and C are attributed to thepresence of small-sized particles.\nCMP performance .\u2014 CMP was performed with the ceria slurry\nwhich was prepared by adding an adequate amount of commercially\navailable anionic acrylic polymers /H20849PMAA /H20850. Cubic CeO\n2/H20849sample A /H20850\nand CeO 2with included hexagonal Ce 2O3particles /H20849sample C /H20850were\nused as abrasive particles. The removal rate trends along the radiusand WIWNU of the oxide \ufb01lm are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, thereis a remarkable difference between the oxide \ufb01lm removal rates ofsamples A and C. The removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lm was dependenton the crystallinity of the ceria particles.\n15The polishing of the\noxide \ufb01lm was mainly affected by the chemical interaction between\nthe ceria particles and the oxide /H20849SiO 2/H20850\ufb01lm, which reacted with the\nhydrated surface to form covalent bonds such as Ce\u2013O\u2013Si and then\npulled off the oxide lumps.20,21As shown in Fig. 1, the particles of\nsample A had a larger crystallinity and narrower particle size distri-bution than those of sample C. Because the hexagonal structuredceria particles and the agglomerated particles of sample C were\nFigure 2.

The surface of the silicon nitride \ufb01lm during polishingwas passivated with an adsorptive surfactant in the slurry, whichprevents the abrasive from directly contacting the \ufb01lm surface.\n23,24\nHence, the removal rates for the Si 3N4\ufb01lm were not in\ufb02uenced by\nthe crystalline structure of the ceria particles. In addition, the slurrywith agglomerated particles was hardly propagated over the wholewafer surface due to poor stability. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4b,sample C has a higher WIWNU and a lower removal rate of waferedge position than those of sample A.\nDuring the CMP, the agglomerated particles were easily stuck to\nthe wafer surface by the small interactive force between the abrasiveand oxide \ufb01lm. In particular, it is these sticking particles that inducethe surface scratches on the wafer due to the compressive and shearforces between the wafer and pad. Therefore, agglomerated particlesare a major cause for the residual particles and the microscratches in\nthe CMP process. The maps of the residual particle counts andscratch counts are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The smallerparticles observed in sample C had a high surface activity and spe-ci\ufb01c surface area. As shown in Fig. 5a, the residual particle countsof sample C are much larger than that of sample A. These residualparticles induced the surface scratching during the CMP process. InFig. 5b, the scratch counts of sample C are also larger than sampleA. Consequently, the ceria powders that include hexagonal struc-tured particles were easily broken down into the smaller particlesand induced particle adhesion on the wafer surface. Therefore, theceria particles should be calcined to a cubic structure through con-trol of the oxygen concentration.\nConclusions\nWe have investigated the effects of the crystalline structure of\nnanosized ceria particles on the physicochemical properties of theceria slurry and the residual particles and microscratches during STICMP. The crystalline structures of the particles were remarkablydifferent as a function of air in\ufb02ow conditions. The particles cal-cined at a higher oxygen concentration were of a cubic structure\n/H20849CeO\n2/H20850but the particles calcined at a low oxygen concentration\nincluded the hexagonal structure /H20849Ce2O3/H20850. The hexagonal structured\nparticles had a smaller particle size than the cubic structured par-\nticles. These smaller particles had a high surface area, which re-sulted in large attractive forces between particles. This caused a lowremoval rate, high numbers of residual particles, and surfacescratches during STI CMP. Consequently, we concluded that thedifferences in the crystalline structure of the ceria particles had a\nprofound effect on the dispersion stability and the residual particlesafter STI CMP.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was \ufb01nancially supported by Korea Institute of Sci-\nence and Technology Evaluation and Planning /H20849KISTEP /H20850through\nthe National Research Laboratory /H20849NRL /H20850program.\nHanyang University assisted in meeting the publication costs of this\narticle.\nReferences\n1.

    "Preparation and characterization\nof slurry for chemical mechanical\nplanarization (CMP)11\nJ. Seo, U. Paik\nHanyang University, Seoul, South Korea\n11.1 Introduction\nSince chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) was developed in the 1980s at IBM, it\nhas played a key role for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing ( Beyer, 1999 ). In the IC\nfabrication process, front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) processeshave been crucial applications of CMP ( Krishnan et al., 2009 ). FEOL CMP is the pro-\ncess that forms the shallow trench isolation (STI) by polishing the gap- \ufb01lling materials\nsuch as SiO\n2. BEOL CMP is used to form metal interconnects including Al, W, and\nCu. In general, CMP slurries are composed of abrasive, oxidizer, organic compounds\nsuch as dispersant and passivation agent, and deionized water (DIW). Speci \ufb01c slurry\nformulations are different depending on the materials to be polished. The physico-chemical properties of slurry that have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performances\nare determined by the complex interactions between its components. As the designrule is reduced, the demands on CMP performance have become more stringent.Thus, understanding the physicochemical properties of slurry is essential to developCMP slurries for next-generation devices including new materials and complexstructures.\n11.2 Preparation of slurry for CMP\nThe CMP process can be divided into interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP, STI CMP, andmetal (W, Cu, and Al) CMP. ILD CMP is a process that polishes dielectric materialssuch as SiO\n2deposited between metal interconnects. Slurries are composed of abra-\nsive, dispersant, and other additives. STI CMP is a process that uniformly polishesthe step height of SiO\n2, formed by the gap- \ufb01lling process, and stop on stopping layer\nsuch as the Si 3N4or poly-silicon (poly-Si) \ufb01lm. There are requirements on the high\npolish rate selectivity between SiO 2and stopping materials to prevent their erosion.\nFor this reason, slurries for STI CMP contain passivation agents for high selectivity.\nContrary to ILD and STI CMP, metal \ufb01lms are hard to remove using abrasives\nbecause of their inertness. Thus, metal CMP slurries need suitable oxidizers to forman oxidation layer on the surface that can be easily removed by abrasives.\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-100165-3.00011-5\nCopyright \u00a92016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nTo formulate these slurries that are suitable for each CMP process, it is very impor-\ntant to understand the role and characteristics of each component in slurries. In this sec-tion, we will discuss the role and characteristics of each component for CMPperformances in detail.\n11.2.1 Abrasive particles\nAbrasive particles are one of the main components in CMP slurry. Silica, ceria,alumina, and other materials have been used as abrasives. Silica abrasives have beenwidely used for ILD, STI CMP, and metal CMP. There are two types of silica abra-sives: fumed and colloidal silica. Figure 11.1 shows their transmission electron micro-\nscopy (TEM) images ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Fumed silica, made from \ufb02ame pyrolysis of\nsilicon tetrachloride (SiCl\n4\u00fe2H2O/SiO 2\u00fe4HCl), has been used as an abrasive\nbecause of its inexpensive price, high purity, and simple synthesis. However, it formsa network structure in an aqueous media caused by weak hydrogen bonding, resulting\nin agglomeration. Thus, subsequent processes such as micro \ufb02uidizer treatment and\n\ufb01ltration process are essential to formulate CMP slurries using fumed silica. Contrary\nto fumed silica, colloidal silica can be made with the desired particle size and uniformsize distribution through hydrolysis of metal organic precursors (by the net reactionhSieOH\u00feHOeSih4hSieOeSih). Silicic acid sodium and organic silicate\nare used as precursors to prepare colloidal silica. Colloidal silica, made from silicicacid sodium, inevitably contains large amounts of sodium ions, which can cause severeproblems such as damage on the gate oxides of a device. In order to use it, the ion-\nexchange process is required to remove sodium ions. Organic silicate can produce\nhigh purity silica compared with silicic acid sodium, and be used as an abrasive forpolishing after the washing and decant process to remove residual precursors. Thedemands on defect become more stringent with a decrease in device dimensions.Thus, fumed silica has recently been replaced by colloidal silica in CMP processesthat require high surface quality of polished \ufb01lm.\n50 nm 50 nm(a) (b)\nFigure 11.1 TEM images of (a) colloidal silica and (b) fumed silica nanoparticle aggregates.\nZhang et al. (2012) .274 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\nCeria has been used as an abrasive for ILD and STI CMP because of its high SiO 2\nremoval rate (RR). It can form strong Ce eOeSi bonding during SiO 2polishing, lead-\ning to a high SiO 2RR ( Cook, 1990 ).\neCeeOH\u00feeSieO/C04eCeeOeSie\u00feOH/C0(11.1)\nCeria abrasives show higher surface quality and selectivity as well as higher RRs of\nSiO 2than silica abrasives. Thus, as an abrasive for SiO 2CMP, silica is being replaced\nby ceria. Figure 11.2 shows TEM images of ceria synthesized through the solid-state\nand solution-grown method ( Seo et al., 2014 ). The solid-state method produces ceria\nabrasives with a controllable crystallite size depending on synthesis conditions ( Kim\net al., 2003 ). However, it has not only large particle size and poor size distribution,\nbut also an angulated shape ( Figure 11.2(a) ). Thus, mechanical milling and \ufb01ltration\nprocesses are essential to obtain the desired particle size and uniform size distribution(Kim et al., 2006 ). Compared with the solid-state method, the solution-grown method\nproduces spherical ceria abrasives with the desired particle size and uniform size dis-\ntribution ( Figure 11.2(b) ). These characteristics of the solution-grown ceria lead to low\ndefects during CMP. Recently, many researchers have studied the physicochemicalproperties of solution-grown ceria to develop defect-free CMP slurries. In Section\n11.3.3 , we will discuss the physicochemical properties of solution-grown ceria in\ndetail.\nAs an abrasive for metal CMP, alumina has been used because of high polish rate\nselectivity between metal (W or Cu) and a barrier metal (Ti/TiN or Ta/TaN) ( Krishnan\net al., 2009 ). Alumina abrasive can exist in various phases ( a,b,g,o rd) depending on\nthe calcination temperature. However, it commonly generates many defects duringpolishing because of its hardness. There have been several studies to overcome theselimitations ( Lei and Zhang, 2007; Zhang and Lei, 2008 ). Lei and Zhang developed the\nalumina/silica core eshell abrasive for polishing hard disk substrates. Zhang and Lei\nreported alumina composite abrasive grafted with polymethacrylic acid for glass pol-ishing. These composite abrasives show improved surface planarization and fewerscratches than pure alumina abrasives because of the cushioning effect of their\n(a)(a)(a) (b)(b)(b)\nFigure 11.2 TEM images of (a) solid-state ceria and (b) solution-grown ceria.\nSeo et al. (2014) .Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 275\nstructure. For this reason, alumina abrasives have been used as the composite structure\nrather than in pure form.\n11.2.2 Dispersants\nDispersants are widely used to improve dispersion stability. According to the DLVO(Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and Overbeek) theory, particles in aqueous media can be\nagglomerated when van der Waals attraction is greater than electrostatic repulsion\n(Verwey et al., 1999; Derjaguin and Landau, 1941 ). By adding suitable dispersants,\nsteric hindrance and electrostatic stabilization between the abrasives are obtained,which prevent abrasives from agglomerating.\nGenerally, abrasive particles in slurry are known to undergo transitions from\nbridging agglomeration /stable/depletion \ufb02occulation with an increase in disper-\nsant concentration ( Kim et al., 2012 ). At a low concentration, dispersants are insuf \ufb01-\ncient for full coverage of the abrasive surface. The free segments (loops and tails) of\nthe adsorbed dispersant on the abrasive surface can attach to other abrasives, leading to\nbridging agglomeration. When an adequate amount of dispersant is added, it fullycovers the abrasive surface, which can improve the dispersion stability through sterichindrance and electrostatic stabilization. Also, dispersants should have strong adsorp-tion energy with the abrasive surface. Weak adsorption energy between dispersant andabrasive surface causes desorption of the dispersant during a particle collision, result-ing in bridging \ufb02occulation ( Sigmund et al., 2000 ). At a high concentration of disper-\nsants, free dispersants (not adsorbed) can promote \ufb02occulation of the stable slurry\nthrough a depletion mechanism ( Asakura and Oosawa, 1954, 1958 ). When two parti-\ncle surfaces approach each other at a distance less than the effective diameter of unab-sorbed dispersants, the dispersants are excluded from the interparticle gap, resulting inan osmotic pressure. This osmotic pressure generates an attractive force between theabrasive particles, which promotes their \ufb02occulation. Thus, it is important to add an\nadequate amount of dispersants for improved dispersion stability.\nLangmuir and Freundlich adsorption models can be used to describe the adsorption\nbehavior of dispersants on an abrasive surface. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm\nmodel assumes that the particle surface is homogeneously covered by the monolayer\ndispersant. It is expressed as follows:\nC\ne=Qe\u00bcCe=Qm\u00fe1=\u00f0KLQm\u00de (11.2)\nwhere Qeis the adsorbed amount of dispersant per surface area of particle at equilib-\nrium (mg/m2),Ceis the concentration of dispersant in the bulk solution (mg/L), Qmis\nthe maximum adsorbed amount of dispersant on particle surface (mg/m2), and KLis\nrelated to the af \ufb01nity of adsorption (L/mg).

To identify the adsorption behavior of dispersant, data are \ufb01tted with Lang-\nmuir and Freundlich adsorption models, and the adsorption model with a higher cor-relation coef \ufb01cient values is chosen.\nFigure 11.3 shows the adsorption isotherm of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on a ceria\nsurface. The Langmuir adsorption model ( R\n2\u00bc0.99) is a much better \ufb01t than the\nFreundlich adsorption model ( R2\u00bc0.87), which indicates that PAA covers the ceria\nsurface homogeneously.\nTo disperse abrasive particles that are us ed for CMP application, several disper-\nsants have been investigated. Surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB)\nand sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have b een investigated for silica slurries\n(Bu and Moudgil, 2007; Basim et al., 2003 ). Basim et al. reported that adsorbed\nCTAB on the silica abrasive provides a strong repulsive force between abrasives,l e a d i n gt os t a b l es l u r r y( Basim et al., 2003 ). However, it also prevents direct contact\nbetween silica abrasives and the oxide \ufb01lm, resulting in a decrease in the friction\nforce during polishing ( Figure 11.4 ). Since the removal of material by silica abrasive\nis mechanically dominant, the decrease in t he friction force inevitably leads to a\nlower material RR (MRR).\nVarious dispersants have been used to disperse ceria abrasive in aqueous media.\nPAA has been widely used to disperse ceria abrasive in CMP ( Sehgal et al., 2005;\nLangmuir model\nFreundlich modelQe (mg/m2)\nCe (mg/L)0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nFigure 11.3 Langmuir and Freundlich plot adsorption isotherm of PAA on ceria surface.Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 277\nPettersson et al., 2000 ). PAA, an anionic surfactant, can adsorb on the highly posi-\ntively charged ceria surface by the attractive electrostatic force. Carboxylic ( eCOOH)\ngroups of PAA adsorbed on the ceria surface are deprotonated to negatively charged\ncarboxylate ( eCOO/C0) groups above their p Kaof 4.5, which improves the dispersion\nstability through an increase in repulsive force between abrasives. The ceria abrasiveschemically remove the materials through interaction between active sites on surfaceand\ufb01lm whereas silica abrasives mechanically remove the material ( Wang et al.,\n2007; Dandu et al., 2011 ). For this reason, a signi \ufb01cant decrease in MRR is not\nobserved because of the PAA adsorbed on the abrasive surface. Kim et al. proposedthat the coadsorption of poly(methyl methacrylate) and hydrogen citrate on the ceria\nsurface can increase the repulsive force between abrasives, which improves dispersion\nstability ( Kim et al., 2010 ).Figure 11.5 shows SiO\n2MRR and within-wafer nonunifor-\nmity (WIWNU) during STI CMP. The results show that the improved dispersion sta-bility leads to an increase in SiO\n2MRR and improved uniformity. Also, the number of\nresidual abrasive particles is signi \ufb01cantly decreased because of the increase in repul-\nsive force between the abrasives and the \ufb01lm.\nThere are several reports that show highly active Ce3\u00feon a ceria surface has in \ufb02u-\nence on SiO 2MRR ( Dandu et al., 2010; Kelsall, 1998 ). Dandu et al. identi \ufb01ed through\nUV-visible spectroscopy that several additives (arginine, ornithine, and lysine) can\ninteract with Ce3\u00feon the ceria surface ( Dandu et al., 2010, 2011 ). These additives\ncan block the Ce3\u00feon the abrasive surface by forming Ce eOeSi bondings during\nSiO 2polishing, leading to a signi \ufb01cant decrease in MRR. Thus, dispersants should\nbe chosen by considering their chemical interaction with abrasives.\nMaterial removal rate ( \u00c5/min)10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Friction force (N)10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nBaseline\nW/O saltBaseline\nW salt140 mM\nC8TAB68 mM\nC10TAB32 mM\nC12TAB\nFigure 11.4 In situ friction force and material removal rate responses of the baseline slurries\n(12 wt%, 2.0 mm primary particle size) and the slurries containing various concentration of\nCTAB in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl at pH 10.5.Basim et al. (2003) .278 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n11.2.3 Passivation agents for high selectivity\nPassivation agents are used for selective removal of a speci \ufb01c material among various\nmaterials during CMP. In STI CMP, polishing is stopped on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm after the\nstep height structure of SiO 2is planarized. In the absence of passivation agents, erosion\nof Si 3N4\ufb01lm, which has a direct in \ufb02uence on device yield, can occur. Generally, an\nanionic surfactant such as PAA has been widely used as a passivation agent for obtain-ing high polish rate selectivity between SiO\n2and Si 3N4(Park et al., 2003; Kim et al.,\n2008 ). PAA can preferentially absorb on the highly positively charged Si 3N4surface\nthrough the attractive electrostatic force ( Hackley, 1997 ). This PAA adsorption layer\nprevents the abrasive from polishing the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, resulting in high polish rate selec-\ntivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4. Kim et al. controlled the conformation of adsorbed\nPAA on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm with the addition of KNO 3(Kim et al., 2008 ). As shown in\nFigure 11.6 , they observed that the adsorbed PAA layer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm is denser\nwith an increase in KNO 3concentration. It is attributed to the charge screening of\nPAA by potassium ions. The densely adsorbed PAA layer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm, formed at\nhigh ionic strength, prevents the ceria abrasives from polishing the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, which\ndecreases the RR of Si 3N4\ufb01lm from 72 to 61 \u00c5/min, resulting in increased polishing\nrate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4.\nPenta et al. investigated four anionic surfactants with different functional groups as\npassivation agents for high selectivity in STI CMP ( Penta et al., 2013a ).Figure 11.7\nshows the RRs of SiO 2and Si 3N4in the presence of four different anionic surfactants.\nAll anionic surfactants can form the bilayer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm below the isoelectric point of\nSi3N4. A monolayer is formed through electrostatic interaction between SiO 2and\nSi3N4, followed by a secondary layer through hydrophobic interaction between the\nsurfactant tails. These adsorption layers suppress the Si 3N4MRR during polishing,\nleading to high polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4. Contrary to these\nsurfactants, the ionic salt K 2SO4adsorbs only weakly on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, and cannot\nsuppress the Si 3N4MRR.\n3000\n2800\n2600\n2400\n2200\n\u2013100 \u201350 0 50 100\nPosition (mm)Ceria with PMMA\nw/o Hydrogen citrate\n0.5 wt% Hydrogen citrate\n1.0 wt% Hydrogen citrate\n2.0 wt% Hydrogen citratePETEOS removal rate (\u00c5/min)1.50\n1.25\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.000 0.5 1 2\nHydrogen citrate concentration (wt%)WIWNU (%)\n(a) (b)\nFigure 11.5 (a) Removal rate trends along radius of SiO 2\ufb01lm and (b) WIWNU of SiO 2\ufb01lm on\nSTI CMP \ufb01eld evaluation.\nKim et al. (2010) .Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 279\nRecently, various amino acids also have been investigated as passivation agents in\nSTI CMP ( Penta et al., 2013b; Veera et al., 2009 ). Penta et al. reported that amino\nacids, having both an amine group and a carboxyl group, can suppress the removalof Si\n3N4through formation of a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group\nof the amino acid and the nitrogen atoms on the Si 3N4. The adsorption of amino acids\non the Si 3N4can prevent the hydrolysis of the Si 3N4. The removal of Si 3N4is signif-\nicantly suppressed. In contrast with the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, amino acids on the SiO 2\ufb01lm are\nweakly bound, and it can be easily removed by abrasives during polishing. As a result,the high polishing rate selectivity between SiO\n2and Si 3N4is shown. Since these amino\nacids are sensitive to a change of pH, they exhibit an \u201con/off \u201dbehavior on the Si 3N4\npassivation as a function of pH. These characteristics of amino acids can be applied to\nformulate CMP slurries for next-generation devices that include new materials andcomplex structures.\nIn NAND \ufb02ash memory beyond 60 nm, the self-aligned poly-Si \ufb02oating gates are\nconstructed without the deposition of Si\n3N4. Thus, polishing rate selectivity between\nSiO 2and poly-Si plays a key role in STI CMP for NAND \ufb02ash. Hydrophobic surfac-\ntants that can preferentially adsorb on poly-Si \ufb01lm have been investigated as passiv-\nation agents for achieving high selectivity between SiO 2and poly-Si. The\nselectivity can be controlled through their different surface energies. Poly-Si \ufb01lm\nhas a lower surface energy than an SiO 2\ufb01lm, and this difference enables preferential\nadsorption of passivation agents on poly-Si \ufb01lm. This passivation layer prevents the\nabrasive from polishing poly-Si \ufb01lm, resulting in high polish rate selectivity. Lee\net al. studied the effects of various nonionic surfactants on selectivity between SiO 2\nand poly-Si in STI CMP for NAND \ufb02ash (Lee et al., 2002 ). As shown in Figure 11.8 ,\nthey reported that the selectivity between SiO 2and poly-Si is signi \ufb01cantly correlated\n0.12\n0.10\n0.100.08\n0.080.06\n0.060.04\n0.04w/o KNO3\n0.2M KNO3\n0.4M KNO30.02\n0.020.00\n0.00\nResidual concentration (g/dL)Adsorbed amount (mg/m2)\nFigure 11.6 Adsorption isotherms for PAA as a function of ionic strength on Si 3N4at pH 6.5.\nKim et al.

Also, CMP slurries containing the nonionic surfactants show a fourfold decreasein WIWNU compared to the conventional oxide slurry.\n11.2.4 Oxidizers\nDuring polishing, metal \ufb01lms are hard to remove by abrasive because of their inertness\nand hardness. With the addition of a suitable oxidizer, a metal can form an oxide layer\non its surface, which can be easily removed during CMP. Since Kaufman et al. \ufb01rst\nproposed a model of the W CMP process using K 3(Fe(CN) 6)(Kaufman et al.,\n1991 ), there have been studies on metal slur ries containing various oxidizers\n120(a)\n(b)100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n135 79 11\n1 3 5 79 11pHpH0.25% K2SO4\n0.25% K2SO40.15% SLSNo additive\n0.15% DP\n0.15% DBSA\n0.25% SDS\n0.15% SLSNo additive\n0.15% DP\n0.15% DBSA\n0.25% SDSSi3N4 RR (nm/min) SiO2 RR (nm/min)\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nFigure 11.7 Removal rates of (a) SiO 2and (b) Si 3N4with addition of anionic surfactants.\nPenta et al.

In general, hydrogen\nperoxide (H 2O2) has been widely used as the oxidize r for commercial metal slurries\nbecause of its low cost and powerful oxid izing capability. However, it can form a\nthick and porous oxide layer with poor surface quality caused by the dissolution\nand oxidation reactions of W ( Lim et al., 2013 ).\nFe ions catalyze the decomposition of H 2O2into the hydroxyl radicals ( \u2219OH),\npowerful oxidants, through the Fenton reaction. These radicals can rapidly form adense oxidation layer on the W \ufb01lm, resulting in high MRR and improved topography\nof W \ufb01lm.Figure 11.9 shows potentiodynamic polarization curves of W \ufb01lm in the\nHLB valuePE-TEOS RR (A/min)3500\n300025002000\n1500\n1000\n500\n01500\n1200\n900\n600\n300\n0\n048 1 2 1 6 2 0PE-TEOS\nPolysiliconOxide-to-polysilicon selectivity 10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n1/HLB valuey = 51.474x \u2013 0.4005\nR2 = 0.99979.33\n2.622.943.604.84\nBrij50series\nBrij30seriesPolysilicon RR (A/min)(a)\n(b)\nFigure 11.8 Removal rates and SiO 2-to-poly-Si selectivity as a function of HLB value of\nthe added Brij surfactant: (a) SiO 2and poly-Si removal rate dependency on the HLB value;\n(b) SiO 2and poly-Si selectivity dependency on the 1/HLB value.\nLee et al.

However, with the\naddition of Fe(NO 3)3, the polarization curves of W \ufb01lm show anodic oxidation\nbehavior. With an increase in Fe(NO 3)3concentrations, current density is shifted to\na lower value. It means that the dissolution of the W \ufb01lm is reduced as a result of\nthe formation of a denser oxidation layer.\nVarious metal salts (Al, Ru, Ce, Co, Mn, Cu, and Cr), which have multiple redox states,\nalso decompose H 2O2into$OH through a Fenton-like reaction ( Bokare and Choi, 2014 ).\nHowever, Fe ions have generally been used as a catalyst to decompose H 2O2into$OH\nbecause of (1) high abundance, (2) an environmentally friendly nature, (3) low toxicity,(4) a highly reactive redox cycle between Fe\n2\u00feand Fe3\u00fe, and (5) low cost.\nRecently, CMP slurries for inactive materials such as ruthenium (Ru) and silicon\ncarbide (SiC) have been proposed for new applications ( Cui et al., 2013; Kurokawa\net al., 2013 ). Several researchers are studying various oxidizers for inactive materials\nCMP. Cui et al. reported that Ru has a remarkable MRR with NaIO 4and NaClO\nbecause of the appropriate energy barrier between the Ru/RuO 2\ufb01lm and the oxidizer.\nKurokawa et al. found that a mixture of N 2and O 2gases as well as KMnO 4can in-\ncrease SiC MRR. In conclusion, choice of suitable oxidizers is very important toachieve the improved CMP performances such as high MRR, high selectivity, unifor-\nmity, and low defects.\n11.2.5 Inhibitors\nIn order to obtain the high MRR, several CMP processes may be performed under high\ndissolution rate of metal \ufb01lm. However, they inevitably lead to problems such as poor\nsurface quality, generation of pits, and high localized etching.

Notoya et al. studied the formation\nof various Cu eBTA complexes depending on the pH ( Notoya and Poling, 1976 ). They\nreported the highest corrosion inhibition of Cu at pH 6. At acidic pH, BTA exists as aprotonated species, making it dif \ufb01cult to form the complexes with positively charged\nCu\ufb01lm because of the repulsive force. Above pH 6, highly soluble Cu\n2\u00feions can be\nprecipitated in the form of Cu(OH) 2and others.\nSurfactants such as CTAB, ammonium dodecyl sulfate, and SDS were also inves-\ntigated as corrosion inhibitors for Cu \ufb01lm. However, these surfactants may cause poor\nslurry stability and insuf \ufb01cient corrosion inhibition. Among various corrosion inhibi-\ntors reported in the literature, BTA is still the most ef \ufb01cient corrosion inhibitor.\nAlthough an addition of a corrosion inhibitor causes a decrease in MRR by preventingthe dissolution of Cu \ufb01lm, it is one of essential components of high planarization and\nimproved surface quality.\n11.3 Characterizations of slurry for CMP\nThe characteristics of slurry such as abrasive particle size and distribution, surfacechemistry, dispersion stability, and rheological behavior are determined by the com-plex interaction between its components, and have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP\nperformances.\nAmong various characteristics of the slurry, abrasive particle size has signi \ufb01cant in-\n\ufb02uence on MRR. There are two models, contact area model and indentation volume\nmodel, to explain it. At the small abrasive particle, the contact area model is dominant.As abrasive size increases, the indentation volume model becomes more appropriate\n(Basim et al., 2000 ). According to Cook \u2019s hypothesis, the active sites on the abrasive\nsurface also play a key role in MRR. These active sites are in \ufb02uenced by various phys-\nicochemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration.Rheological behavior of CMP slurries is also important because their mass transporton the pad can effect three-body (slurry epadewafer) interaction. Hence, it is very\nimportant to understand the characteristics of slurry because they have signi \ufb01cant in-\n\ufb02uence on CMP performances.\n11.3.1 Abrasive characteristics: size and concentration\nAbrasives in the size range 30 e300 nm (aggregated size) have been used for polishing.\nHowever, the effect of abrasive size on CMP performance remains contradictory\n(Figure 11.10 ). Bielmann et al. reported that the removal mechanism of W \ufb01lm is\nrelated to the contact area between abrasive and wafer. As shown inFigure 11.10(a) , the W MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size ( Bielmann\net al., 1999 ). MRR based on the contact area model is expressed as follows ( Basim\net al., 2000 ):\nMRRf/C16\nAfC1=3\n0$F/C01=3/C17\n(11.5)284 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\nwhere Ais the total contact area between abrasive and \ufb01lm,C0is the concentration of\nabrasive, and Fis the abrasive diameter. When the CMP conditions and solid concen-\ntration are \ufb01xed, the MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size.\nHowever, others suggest the opposite conclusions ( Tamboli et al., 2004; Lei\nand Luo, 2004 ). Tamboli et al. suggested that the MRR is increased with an\nincrease in abrasive size in CMP for tant alum and tetra-ethyl ortho-silicate\n(T a m b o l ie ta l . ,2 0 0 4 ). As shown in Figure 11.10(b) , Lei et al. also showed that\nlarger abrasive size leads to an increase in MRR for polishing hard disk substrate\n7 (a)\n6\n5\n4\nIn (median particle size) ( \u03bcm)In (removal rate) (nm/min)\n\u20131.8\u20131.5 \u20131.2 \u20130.9\u20130.6 \u20130.3 0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.6 2.1 2.4\n(b) 22\n19\n16\n13\n10\n05 0\nParticle average diameter (nm)100 150Material removal amount\n(\u00d7 0.04 nm)\nFigure 11.10 Effect of the particle size on MRR: (a) W MRR as a function of particle size\nfor different solids loading ( Bielmann et al., 1999 ); (b) MRR for hard disk substrate as a function\nof particle diameter ( Lei and Luo, 2004 ).Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 285\n(Lei and Luo, 2004 ). At larger abrasive sizes, the indentation volume model\nbecomes more appropriate:\nMRRf/C16\nVfC/C01=3\n0$F4=3/C17\n(11.6)\nwhere Vis the indentation volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer. The indenta-\ntion volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer becomes larger because of an in-crease in abrasive size, which can increase the MRR.\nThese opposite conclusions are because slurry formulation and material removal\nmechanisms are different depending on the types of materials to be polished. In any\ncase, the large abrasive sizes can produce the scratch defects on \ufb01lms during CMP\n(Remsen et al., 2005, 2006 ). Since the number of maximum permissible defects is\ncontinually lowered with decreasing device dimensions, CMP slurries containingsmaller abrasive sizes have been investigated.\nThe concentrations as well as the size of the abrasives have an effect on MRR.\nThere are three distinct regions of MRR dependence on abrasive concentration ( Lee\net al., 2009; Luo and Dornfeld, 2003 )(Figure 11.11 ). First, MRR rapidly increases\nwith an increase in abrasive concentration, which indicates that chemical removal of\nmaterial is dominant at low concentrations. Second, as mechanical removal becomesdominant, MRR is proportional to the abrasive concentration. And third, the dominantmechanical effect is saturated because the contact area between abrasive and the wafersurface is at a maximum. Although the MRR varied with the abrasive concentrationdepending on the types of abrasives, \ufb01lms, and additives, their trends are quite similar.\nIn practice, the silica slurries have high solids contents of 5 e50 wt% whereas the ceria\nand alumina slurries have low solid contents ( w5 wt%).\n60\n\u2013 1 0123\nAbrasive concentration (wt%)45678 980100120Material removal rate (nm/min)140160180200\nFigure 11.11 MRR as a function of abrasive concentration.\nLee et al.

At the pH pzc, abrasive particles show zero zeta potential.\nThis insuf \ufb01cient surface charge between abrasive particles decreases the energy barrier\nfor agglomeration, resulting in poor dispersion stability. Thus, it has to be formulatedat pH<pH\npzcor pH >pHpzcwhere abrasive particles have a highly charged surface.\nFigure 11.12 shows the electrokinetic behaviors of materials used in STI CMP ( Kim\net al., 2003 ). The surface potentials of all materials are strongly dependent on the sus-\npension pH. The SiO 2shows negative charge above pH pzc3. Its charge is slightly\ndecreased with an increase in pH above pH 9, which is attributed to the compressionof the electrical double layer by dissolved Si ions ( Paik et al., 2001 ). Si\n3N4shows a\nnegative charge above pH pzc6.5 by the formation of SiO/C0. In the pH range 3 e6.5,\nSiO 2and Si 3N4\ufb01lms show different surface charge.

With\nthe addition of anionic dispersants, ceria abrasive shows a highly negative charge inthe pH range 2.5 e11.\nThe surface charges of ceria are different depending on their synthesis methods\n(Figure 11.13 ). Whereas solid-state ceria forms the hydroxyl groups in aqueous media,\nsolution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentrations of nitrate ions that orig-inate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate ( Nabavi et al., 1993 ). These nitrate ions\npreferentially adsorb on the surface during synthesis. For this reason, the pH\npzcof\nsolid-state ceria and solution-grown ceria are observed at slightly different pH values,8.3 and 10.4, respectively. Adsorption of speci \ufb01c ions on the abrasive surface can\nchange the surface charge as a function of pH, which modi \ufb01es their CMP perfor-\nmances. This will be discussed in Section 3.3.3.\nIn contrast with STI CMP slurries, metal CMP slurries have higher ionic strength\nbecause of the addition of oxidizer, inhibitors, and complexing agents. At high ionicstrength, counter ions are attracted to the charged interface and form a diffuse ion\n\u201ccloud \u201dadjacent to the particle surface. Counter ions surrounding the interface of par-\nticles reduce the surface charge of the particles through charge screening, which causesagglomeration and settling. Choi et al. studied the effect of ionic strength on CMP(Choi et al., 2004 ). They observed agglomerations of particle at high ionic strength\nbecause surface charge is decreased by the charge screening. Although the agglomer-ated particles can increase the MRR because of their larger size, they cause signi \ufb01cant\nsurface damages on \ufb01lm during polishing.\nFigure 11.14 shows the addition of the various surfactants such as CPC (cationic\nsurfactant), SDS (anionic surfactant), and Triton X-100 (nonionic surfactant) in\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\u20130.2\n\u20130.4\n3456 7\npHSolid-state ceriaESA (mPa* M/V)\nSolution-grown ceria\n89 10 11 120.0\nFigure 11.13 Electrokinetic behaviors of solid-state and solution-grown ceria as a function\nof pH.\nSeo et al.

All these slurries show\nvery rapid settling although fractional volume for settling varies with the surfactants.Palla and Shah proposed various strategies to disperse the abrasive particles at highionic strength ( Figure 11.15 ). They suggested that the slurries with mixed anionic\nFigure 11.14 Effects of ionic or nonionic surfactant addition on high ionic strength slurry\ncontaining 0.1 M potassium ferricyanide oxidizing agent.

This surfactant structure is not affected by ionicstrength.\n11.3.3 Surface chemistry\nIn an aqueous media, abrasive particles are sensitive to the changes in their physico-chemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration,which have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on their surface chemistry. Hence, an understanding\nof the surface chemistry of the abrasive particles is essential for their CMP application.Seo et al. have identi \ufb01ed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that\nsurface functional groups of ceria abrasive varied with synthesis methods ( Seo et al.,\n2014 ). The eOH groups on the ceria surface can be generated by dissociation reaction\nof H\n2O on the defect site. In general, solid-state ceria forms the eOH groups in\naqueous media. However, solution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentra-\ntions of nitrate ions, which originate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate. Thesenitrate ions were covalently bound on the surface during synthesis, which have an in-\ufb02uence on CMP performance. Seo et al. experimentally and theoretically demonstrated\nthe effect of surface functional groups such as eNO\n3andeOH groups on CMP per-\nformance ( Seo et al., 2014 ). Experimental results derived from adsorption isotherms of\nsilicate ions on ceria surface show the eNO3group has a much higher af \ufb01nity with\nsilicate than the eOH group. Theoretical analysis using density functional theory\ncalculation shows that the binding energy of the NO 3-ceria ( /C04.383 eV) on the\nSiO 2surface is much higher than that of the OH-ceria ( /C03.813 eV) ( Figure 11.16 ).\nAs shown in Figure 11.17 , the CMP result shows that the SiO 2RR of NO 3-ceria\n(360 nm/min) is higher than that of OH-ceria (274 nm/min). These results implythat surface functional groups of particle surface have a signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on\nCMP performance.\nThe synthesis methods as well as pH of the reaction medium have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02u-\nence on the surface chemistry of the synthesized materials. Wu et al. reported that the\npH of a reaction medium has an in \ufb02uence on the crystallization of ceria under hydro-\nthermal methods ( Wu et al., 2002 ). The result showed that grain growth in acidic me-\ndium is faster due to the dissolution rate of precursor than that in alkaline medium.Ceria, synthesized in an acidic medium, has higher Ce\n3\u00feconcentrations on the surface\nthan those synthesized in an alkaline medium. Presumable, it shows high SiO 2MRR\ncaused by the high Ce3\u00feconcentrations.\nAbrasive sizes less than 100 nm are extremely sensitive to changes in their\nphysico-chemical environments because of the higher surface energy compared to\nlarger abrasives. The formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves electrons at the surface,\nwhich reduces Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00feions ( Tsunekawa et al., 1999 ).Figure 11.18 shows lat-\ntice parameter as a function of size of ceria. Tsunekawa et al. found through the elec-tron diffraction patterns that small size ceria has higher Ce\n3\u00feconcentrations\ncompared to bulk ceria. They reported that it is attributed to the increased surface-to-volume ratio of the small particle.290 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\nSurface chemistry of silica also varies with synthesis methods ( Zhang et al., 2012 ).\nFigure 11.19(a) shows the normalized Raman spectra results of fumed and colloidal\nsilica. Spectral bands at w600 cme1,w490 cme1, andw450 cme1are related to\nthree-, four-, and \ufb01ve-membered siloxane rings, respectively ( Brinker et al., 1988 ).\nFumed silica has prominent bands at w600 cme1,w490 cme1, andw450 cme1,\nwhile colloidal silica has none at w600 cme1.

Figure 11.19(b) shows\nFTIR analysis of silanol concentration in fumed and colloidal silica. Broad peaks at4500 cm\ne1are related to the total (hydrogen-bonded and isolated) hydroxyl concentra-\ntion, and peaks at 3460 cme1and 3750 cme1are related to hydrogen-bonded vicinal\nand isolated silanols, respectively. Fumed silica has a lower total hydroxyl content(2.8 OH/nm\n2) and a higher portion of isolated silanol than colloidal silica (4.5 OH/\nnm2). These reactive sites on the surface produce $OH with H 2O2or water according\nto a Fenton-like reaction ( Fubini and Hubbard, 2003 ). The reactivity between silica\nand H 2O2is very important because H 2O2has been widely used as oxidants for metal\nslurries.\nSilica abrasives show different surface chemistry as the abrasive size decreases.\nKamiya et al. studied the effect of silica size on surface silanol structure throughFTIR ( Kamiya et al., 2000 ). For relatively small particles ( <10 nm in diameter), the\nisolated silanol is observed. However, as the particle diameter increased to >30 nm,\nthe surface density of the isolated silanol decreased, and hydrogen-bonded silanol\ngroups are Increased due to the strong hydration force between the silanols. These\nsize-dependent differences of surface chemistry of silica can lead to a variation of sur-face charge on silica ( Puddu and Perry, 2014 )(Figure 11.20 ). With an increase in the\nparticle size, an increase in surface charge is observed. Although there is no report thatthe effect of surface chemistry varied with particle size on CMP performance, under-standing the surface chemistry of abrasive particles is very important because it has asigni\ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performance.\nSi\u2013O\u2013SiSi\u2013O\u2013Si\nSi\u2013OH\n800 600 400 200 1000Detector counts\nSt\u00f6ber SiO2St\u00f6ber SiO2\n200 300 400 500600 700 200 300 400500 600 700Fumed SiO2\nFumed SiO2\u03bdOH (isolated Si\u2013OH)\n\u03bdOH\n(\u03bd + \u03b4) Si\u2013OH0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00Normalized\nabsorbance\n2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000\ncm\u20131cm\u20131\ncm\u20131cm\u201313700\n37003750\n37503800\n38004300\n43004500\n45004700\n4700400 \u00b0C\n200 \u00b0CNo treatment 800 \u00b0C\nRehydrated 600 \u00b0C0.02 A.U.\n0.02 A.U.0.001 A.U.\n0.002 A.U.(a) (b)\nFigure 11.19 Physical and spectroscopic characterization of fumed and colloidal silica\nnanoparticles: (a) Raman spectroscopy of silica samples used to examine the relative\nconcentration of four- and three-membered ring structures; (b) FTIR analysis of silanolconcentration in fumed and colloidal silica using vibrational bands at w3745 cm\ne1\n(nonhydrogen-bonded silanols only) and 4500 cme1(total silanol population).\nZhang et al.

These slurries form a liquid \ufb01lm between the polishing pad and the\nwafer, which determines the contact regime between them. Figure 11.21 is the coef \ufb01-\ncient of friction (COF) as a function of a lubrication parameter ( hV/P), which is known\nas the Stribeck curve; it shows three distinct regions: boundary lubrication, mixedlubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication ( Philipossian and Olsen, 2003 ). Boundary\nlubrication is dominated by solid esolid contact. In this regime, the COF shows a high\nvalue because of direct contact between the solid surfaces. However, the COF is not\nFigure 11.20 Zeta potential of silica nanoparticles as a function of pH.\nPuddu and Perry (2014) .\nFriction coefficient (\u00b5)(I) Boundary\nlubrication(II) Mixed\nlubrication\n(III) Hydrodynamic\nlubricationh\nh\nFilm thickness (h)\u03bc\nVelocity x viscosity\nLoad\nFigure 11.21 Friction coef \ufb01cient plotted as a function of \ufb02uid viscosity and shear velocity\ndivided by load (Stribeck curve) with corresponding lubrication \ufb01lm thickness.\nColes et al. (2010) .294 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\nsigni\ufb01cantly changed despite an increase in the lubrication parameter. The second re-\ngion is known as partial lubrication, where the liquid \ufb01lm formed between the pad and\nwafer is more important and the COF decreases with an increase in the lubricationparameter. The third region is hydrodynamic lubrication, which shows the low COFvalue. The pad and wafer are fully separated because of the formation of thick liquid\ufb01lm. The COF increases slightly with an increase in the lubrication parameter. Mul-\nlany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically investigated the effect of slurry vis-cosity on MRR ( Mullany and Byrne, 2003 ). As viscosity is increased while other\nvariables such as velocity and pressure were kept constant, the thickness of liquid\n\ufb01lm is greater ( Figure 11.22(a) ). This thick liquid \ufb01lm decreases the COF value, result-\ning in a decrease in MRR ( Figure 11.22(b) ). The COF against the lubrication param-\neter shows a downward slope. Thus, they suggested that the experiment was processedin the partial lubrication region.\n11.4 Conclusion\nIn this chapter, we described the role of each component in CMP slurry, and discussed\nthe characterization of slurries for CMP. Since CMP was developed in the 1980s,\nmany researchers have investigated CMP slurries in a variety of ways. However, thereis still a need to understand more profoundly how the slurry characteristics affect CMPperformance. These issues can be solved through a fundamental study of powder tech-nology, surface chemistry, and colloidal chemistry.\nReferences\nAsakura, S., Oosawa, F., 1954.
