Several colloidal slurries with various additives can yield the desired high rate selectivity between the oxide and nitride \ufb01lms during CMP while maintaining an acceptably low nitride rate. Here, many of such high selectivity STICMP slurries described in the literature are reviewed along with the characteristics of the colloidal dispersions like the abrasives, additives, the interactions between them and with the \ufb01lms being planarized and the associated pH range in which the high selectivity is observed. The mechanisms proposed to explain the high reactivity of ceria with oxide, the role of additives in suppressing thenitride removal rate and resulting high selectivity are discussed. Reduction of a multitude of defects in post-CMP processed STIstructures still remains an important challenge, especially as the feature sizes continue to shrink. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.

This paper is part of the JSS Focus Issue on Chemical Mechanical Planarization: Advanced Material and Consumable Challenges. Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is one of the important enabling processes in facilitating multilevel metallization (in some cases reaching up to 14 levels) and incorporation of novel gate andchannel materials at the component level in modern semiconduc-tor device manufacturing where its use has become widespread andubiquitous. 1\u20136Here, we review recent advances and remaining chal- lenges in one speci\ufb01c application of CMP, the shallow trench isolation(STI) process. STI is a method of electrically isolating active areasusing trenches created in the Si substrate around the active elementsand \ufb01lling it with an insulating dielectric, such as silicon dioxide or sil-icon oxy-nitride or silicon carbonitride. 7\u201311Process details of the STI structures are available in numerous publications. There are a mul-titude of techniques available for oxide deposition and even thoughthe resulting oxides have very different properties, for simplicity we do not distinguish between them in this review. For completeness and ease of reference, a schematic representation of the STI process isgiven in Figure 1. While the trenches are being \ufb01lled, silicon dioxide also deposits over unwanted areas on the entire wafer (since selective deposition in trenches only is not possible) creating an uneven topog-raphy. The excess and unwanted oxide has to be completely removedand CMP has proven to be the only viable and robust global and localplanarization capable process technology. Here, as shown in Figure 1, presence of a very thin silicon nitride stop layer (deposited on another thin pad oxide layer to control \ufb01lm stress) is an essential and integral part of the process. This nitride stoplayer prevents any damage during planarization to the all-importantepitaxially grown surface underneath and is itself removed by a wetetch process subsequent to the overburden oxide removal. Since theintegrity of the nitride layer is crucial, thinning of the nitride shouldbe minimized at all costs, implying that the oxide to nitride removalrate (RR) ratio, or selectivity, must be high. At the same time, a veryhigh oxide \ufb01lm RR can lead to undesirable thinning of the \ufb01eld oxidein the trenches, making accurate end point control critical. Finally,if any of the oxide over the nitride is not removed, it interferes withthe subsequent removal of the nitride itself. Indeed, while planarizingpatterned STI features, metrics like the extent of nitride and \ufb01eld oxide \u2217Electrochemical Society Active Member. cPresent address: Intel Corp., Hillsboro, Oregon 97124, USA. zE-mail: babu@clarkson.eduloss across widely varying patterns, dishing, sensitivity to overpolish, defects, and within wafer (WIW) and die (WID) uniformity - and notjust selectivity \u2013 become overarching for evaluating the performanceof a slurry and we discuss them here only in a cursory manner and focusmostly on polish rates and the underlying mechanisms. As devicedimensions continue to shrink, meeting these combined challengeshas become even more dif\ufb01cult. It is known that the rate selectivity can be altered by carefully choosing the components, viz. abrasives and additives, of the colloidal slurry used to achieve the planarization with more emphasis beingplaced now on their role on defects in the post-polished surfaces. 12 A low oxide polish rate even with complete suppression of nitrideremoval is not desirable, since the excess oxide has to be removedrapidly to ensure adequate throughput. As such, the STI planariza- tion can sometimes be implemented in two steps, \ufb01rst with a high selectivity and high oxide polish rate slurry to remove most of theoverburden oxide followed by a second step in which a low or 1:1selectivity slurry is use. Normally, ceria or silica based slurries areemployed in STI CMP, with a more recent emergence of core/shelltype abrasives, again with the expectation of mitigating defects. In theabsence of any additives, both the silica or ceria slurries tend to polishnot only the oxide but also the nitride surface at rates that are notlow enough. Compared to silica abrasives, ceria particles yield higherremoval rates of both oxide and nitride surfaces. 13,14Certain chemi- cals, when added to the slurry, suppress the nitride removal without adversely affecting the oxide removal, thus enhancing the selectivity.In some applications such as damascene gate process, the nitride RRmust be higher than oxide RR, i.e. reverse of the usual selectivity ofthe STI process. 15 Since CMP uses abrasives, scratches can form on the surface and lead to yield loss. Other defects, such as residual particles, need to be removed in post-CMP cleaning step. The defect leveland type of defects formed depend, as in any CMP process, on theslurry formulation as well as other parameters such as the shape andsize of abrasives, type of pad used, conditioning, operating pres-sure etc. In this review, we focus our attention on high selectiv-ity STI CMP slurries with very low nitride polish rates and slur-ries with reverse selectivity as well as the underlying mechanisms.The status of experimental results and analysis are compiled and the models proposed to explain them are summarized. The gaps in the literature are identi\ufb01ed and directions for future work areoutlined. ) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

Mechanisms Silicon dioxide removal mechanism.\u2014 An early material polishing model was developed by Brown et al.16who proposed that the abrasive particles penetrate into the work surface under the applied force and move with the pad, abrading the surface. This model was initially usedon metals 16and later extended to the polishing of glass surfaces.17 Based on the polishing rates of glass in ethylene glycol and watermixture, Silvernail and Goetzinger 18identi\ufb01ed the necessity for the presence of water for glass polishing. Later, Iler19proposed that the Si-O-Si bonds present on the surface of silica react with water, given by a reversible polymerization and depolymerization reaction, shownbelow. (SiO 2)x+2H 2O\u2194(SiO 2)x\u22121+Si(OH)4 Silicon dioxide surface can be polished by different metal oxide abra- sives such as those of cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxideand thorium oxide besides silicon dioxide itself. Due to its amphotericnature, ceria was considered an excellent polishing agent comparedto other metal oxides. Cook 13proposed that polishing particles such as ceria or zirconia possess a great af\ufb01nity toward the oxide, which he called as \u201cchemical-tooth\u201d, which helps in breaking the bonds onthe silica surface. The surface of silicon dioxide, in water, is expectedto be terminated with -Si-OH. At some of these sites, an OH \u2212ion in water can remove H+, resulting in -Si-O\u2212termination. According to the mechanism proposed by Cook13cerium oxide, when dispersed in water, contains Ce-OH groups, which react with the surface sites Si-O\u2212forming Ce-O-Si and subsequently release Si(OH) 4into theCe4+ O- Si4+Si4+Adapted from Cook 13 O-(a) Ceria Lump of SiO2SiO2lump into the dispersionAdapted from Ref.

The proposed reaction is written as -Ce-OH +-Si-O\u2212\u2194-Si-O-Ce- +OH\u2212 Since the Ce-O-Si bonds are stronger than Si-O-Si bonds, this results in the polishing of the silicon dioxide surface by both chemical andmechanical actions (Figure 2a). 13Thus, SiO 2is removed one molecule at a time, as Si(OH) 4. A similar mechanism was proposed by Kelsall,20but he suggested that it is the Ce3+species that are present on the surface of ceria abra- sives that react with the hydrated silicon dioxide surface. Later, Sabiaand Stevens 21proposed that the polishing between the ceria abrasives and silicon dioxide is due to the reaction between the particles and the work surface, promoted by the presence of Ce3+on the abrasive surface. Later, Hoshino et al.,22proposed a different model in which the Si-O-Si bonds react with hydroxylated ceria in water, formingCe-O-Si bonds, and removing SiO 2in the form of lumps (Figure 2b) rather than in the form of single molecules of Si(OH) 4as proposed by Cook.13They supported this hypothesis using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emis-sion spectroscopy analysis of the post polish slurry containing thematerial removed. Wang et al. 23reported that the material RR in- creased from 250 nm/min to 675 nm/min when the concentration ofceria abrasives in the slurry was lowered from 1 wt% to 0.25 wt% atpH 4, which is counter intuitive since an increase in abrasive concen-tration may be expected to lead to an increase in RR in the initial stagesand saturation at some higher abrasive concentrations. Based on theUV-VIS absorption spectra of solutions containing various quantitiesof ceria abrasives, they claimed that a decrease in the concentrationof ceria in the slurry resulted in the conversion of Ce 4+to Ce3+,a g a i n suggesting an important role for Ce3+. However, there are no con\ufb01r- matory reports in literature on the decrease in silicon dioxide RR withan increase in ceria concentration. Using their own data and the results of Kelsall 21and Wang et al.,23 Veera Dandu et al.24proposed speci\ufb01cally that Ce3+(and not Ce4+) present on the ceria abrasives enhance the oxide RR (Figure 2c). This hypothesis was supported by UV-visible spectroscopy data where thespectral peak height associated with the Ce 3+was monitored as well ) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

They also showed that whenthe concentrations of the additives (used to suppress nitride but notoxide removal) were high enough, the oxide removal rates were alsoreduced, likely due to the blocking of the active Ce 3+surface sites by the additives. More recently, Seo et al.25proposed that the reactivity of ceria particles depends on the physicochemical conditions duringtheir synthesis. Based on adsorption isotherms and theoretical analy-ses using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they predictedthat nitrate ions (source of nitrate is either the precursor or the pH ad-justing agent or both) show a higher af\ufb01nity than hydroxyl ions towardsilicate groups. CMP results showed that the ceria functionalized withnitrate groups exhibit higher removal rates when compared to ceriafunctionalized with hydroxyl groups. We discuss the role of the Ce 3+ surface species at some length later in the section on the reactivity ofceria abrasives. Silicon nitride removal mechanism.\u2014 Suppression of the nitride \ufb01lm RR is essential to an acceptable STI process. An understandingof the nitride polishing mechanism will give an insight in choosingan additive which can enhance the selectivity. Silicon nitride is harderthan silicon dioxide or ceria. When exposed to water or air, the nitridesurface gets easily oxidized to silicon dioxide. 26The overall oxidation reactions are given below. Si3N4+3O 2\u21923S i O 2+2N 2 Si3N4+6H 2O\u21923S i O 2+4N H 3 During the CMP of silicon nitride, it is believed that the nitride layeris not removed directly, but only the top layer consisting of silicondioxide is removed. Hu et al. 27proposed a sequence of hydrolysis reactions that convert the Si 3N on the nitride surface to \u2013Si-O-Si- structures and NH 3. During CMP, the chemically modi\ufb01ed nitride surface layer may be further hydrated in the presence of water, \u2261Si-O-Si \u2261+ H2O\u2192Si(OH)4 with the hydrolyzed silica being removed by mechanical wear.27Note that this equation is not balanced. This suggests that if the conversion of silicon nitride to oxide is inhibited, then the nitride removal maybe suppressed since the ceria particles are softer than the nitride \ufb01lm.Indeed, proline and other amino acids, when added to a ceria slurry,can preferentially adsorb on the surface of silicon nitride preventingits oxidation to silicon dioxide and suppress nitride removal. 28 Nitride rate suppression mechanism.\u2014 It is important to reiterate that in STI CMP, a low nitride RR ( <1 nm/min) is a key require- ment. Even a moderate nitride RR (e.g. \u223cfew nm/min) will cause unacceptable thinning of the nitride stop layer. In order to understand how various additives suppress the nitride or, in some cases, oxideremoval, various studies have been performed and the reports aresummarized below. America and Babu 28proposed that the nitride RR can be reduced to low values by adding a suitable chemical, an aminoacid, which adsorbs on the nitride and inhibits its hydrolysis to silicondioxide. The oxygen atoms present on the carboxylic group of theadditives form a bidentate structure with the silanol groups presenton the surface of silicon nitride along with simultaneous hydrogenbonding between the amino H and surface N atom (Figure 3). These bonds are strong enough to prevent exposure of the underlying nitride\ufb01lm to the abrasives. They also suggested that, for the additive to beeffective, the hydrogen bonding group of the additive be in the alphaposition relative to the acid group. Carter and Johns 29proposed that the nitride removal rates in high selective slurries are suppressed by a site blocking mechanism inwhich the additives block the active sites on silicon nitride, preventingthem from forming SiO \u2212and inhibiting further polishing. They also suggested that, when a suf\ufb01ciently high concentration of the additives is used in the slurry, the additives are likely to suppress silicon dioxideRR also. In another study with three different additives - pyridine Bidentate Bonding Hydrogen BondingNitrogen Carbon Silicon Oxygen Hydrogen Figure 3. Cartoon showing the bond formation between proline and silicon nitride surface. Adapted from America and Babu.28 HCl, imidazole and piperazine -with ceria slurries, it was reported the nitride RR was suppressed at pH 4 and 5 while the oxide removal ratesremained high. 30These authors reported that the additives cover the surface of silicon nitride more or less completely, but there is only a partial coverage on the surface of silicon dioxide with relatively weakcoupling, which results in continued polishing of silicon dioxide. Penta et al. 31investigated silicon dioxide and silicon nitride re- moval in ceria based slurries, in the presence of picolinic acid, nico- tinic acid, proline and \u03b3-amino butyric acid as a function of pH and additive concentration. These amino acids, based on pKa values, can exist in different forms in different pH ranges. The results were ana-lyzed by comparing the polishing behavior with the additive speciespresent at the respective slurry pH. The adsorption of amino acidonto the silicon dioxide and silicon nitride surfaces at various pH wasevaulated by derivative thermograms. The results showed that the pro-tonated amino group, present only in a speci\ufb01c pH range, can forma strong hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of the silicon nitridesurface and the strength of this bond hinders nitride hydrolysis as wellas subsequent polishing. This result was recently extended to other classes of additives, namley alcohols and carboxylic acids, see Penta et al in this focus issue. However, for effective suppression of nitride removal, the amino acid must be available in suf\ufb01cient quantity, which may not be the case if it is also strongly adsorbed on the high surface area abrasive parti-cles. This can explain the results of Manivannan and Ramanathan, 32 who found that in ceria based slurries, at pH 4, addition of glutamicacid lowered the oxide RR from \u223c40 nm/min to <1 nm/min, and the nitride RR from \u223c8 nm/min to <1 nm/min while at pH 5, 6 and 7, the oxide RR was \u223c60 nm/min while the nitride RR was <1 nm/min.However, glutamic acid did not lower the oxide and ni-tride rates in silica slurries. In this case, since the surface area of theparticles in the 5 wt% silica dispersion is much larger than the surfacearea of the particles in the ceria based slurries (0.25 wt%) and theamino acids tend to adsorb well on the silica surface, 30,33it is likely that the amino acid remaining in the solution in the silica slurry is not suf\ufb01cient to prevent nitride removal.31 Also, in some cases, the additive can adsorb on both oxide and nitride surfaces, but still lower only the nitride rate and not the oxiderate. 30,33In such cases, the strength of the coupling between the addi- tive and the \ufb01lm being polished is important as was shown by Veera Dandu et al.30In this case, even though pyridine HCl adsorbed on both oxide and nitride surfaces, it lowered only the nitride rate. Basedon contact angle and polishing rate data, they concluded that the ad-ditive was easily removed by the polishing process from the oxide but not from the nitride, presumably due to stronger coupling. Sim- ilar argument can be used to explain the results of Nagendra Prasadand Ramanathan 33who found that, even though both L-proline and L-arginine adsorb to a similar extent on the surface of silicon dioxideat pH 9, 10 and 11 and to a smaller but again similar extent on siliconnitride, proline suppressed only nitride RR while arginine suppressedboth oxide and nitride removal rates. ) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

    "P5032 ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Technology ,4(11) P5029-P5039 (2015) High Selectivity Slurries Ceria-based slurries.\u2014 The published literature, especially patent literature, on high selectivity STI CMP slurries is replete with additives that can enhance the oxide to nitride RR selectivity.

This list is incomplete and the patents cata- logue many more additives as selectivity enhancement agents. Theselectivity values should not be considered precise since they canvary signi\ufb01cantly even with only small changes, even if caused byexperimental error, in the nitride polish rates. The actual selectivity depends on the abrasive and additive con- centrations and the pH of the slurry as well as the characteristics ofthe ceria used. Some slurries exhibit high selectivity only in a nar-r o wp Hr a n g e 34\u201337while others exhibit high selectivity in a wider pH range.42\u201346While some of the patents mention the particle size and the method of synthesis of the ceria abrasive (colloidal, solid state dis- placement, etc.), such information was not provided in most cases. In a few patents, the possible mechanism of high selectivity was hintedat, 29,42\u201346,49for example, the adsorption of the additive on the nitride surface, but in most there was no explanation. In some cases, appar-ently contradictory results were observed. For example, Srinivasanet al. 42\u201346reported that slurries with L-proline yielded high selectivity while Carter and John29reported that a similar slurry yielded low se-lectivity. This is likely due to differences in the method of synthesis,purity level and size of the ceria abrasives used, as discussed later inthe section on the reactivity of ceria. Slurries based on other abrasives.\u2014 Most of the reported studies on STI CMP dispersions used ceria or silica abrasives. Even thoughceria particles are known to be prone to cause more defects, silicaslurries are not the preferred choice in many cases due to high solidsrequirement ( >10 wt%) to obtain reasonable oxide RRs and associated defects and post-CMP cleaning challenges. In contrast, ceria can yield high RRs with even \u223c0.25 wt% of particle loading which can result in signi\ufb01cant cost savings for both high volume manufacturing and waste treatment. Also, it remains a challenge to enhance rate selectivity withsilica slurries. Some of the additives reported to yield high selectiv-ity, relatively speaking, in silica based slurries are: cerium nitrateand acetic acid, 56triethanol amine,57surfactants such as ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and dodecylben-zenesulfonic acid or triethanolamine dodecylbenzenesulfonate. 58 Penta et al.,59investigated the removal of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms in slurries with 10 wt% silica in the pH range of 2 to10 containing anionicsurfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), dodecyl phosphate (DDP) and sodium laurylsarcosine (SLS). When the pH was between 2 to 4, the nitride pol-ishing rate was suppressed to <1 nm/min without affecting oxide removal rates. Beyond pH 4, silicon nitride removal was not sup- pressed. The authors proposed that when the slurry pH <IEP of the nitride surface, nitride rate suppression is caused by the adsorption of the anionic surfactants, validated by TGA results and zeta potentialmeasurements. Reverse Selectivity During the fabrication sequence of metal gates, slurries with high nitride RR and low oxide RR are required. 15,60,61It is also possible to use such slurries to remove the nitride layer remaining Table I.

The combination of abrasivesand additives employed, the pH range in which reverse selectivity wasreported and the reverse selectivity values are summarized in Table II for reference. Veera Dandu et al. 64proposed that the negatively charged car- boxylic groups of the PAD polymer strongly bind to the positivelycharged ceria surface, possibly by bi-dentate structure, while thecationic amine groups are on the unadsorbed side away from theceria surface. These amine groups can bind to the negatively chargedsub-oxide on the nitride surface and, hence, the oxide layer can bepulled away from the nitride surface by the relative motion of the waferacross the pad, presumably due to the weak nature of Si-Si presentat the interface between sub-oxide and silicon nitride. Furthermore,it is very likely that the cationic amine groups of the polymer bind strongly to the negatively charged silicon dioxide surface while the anionic carboxylic acids are on the unadsorbed side. Similarly, Kimet al. 61showed that the adsorption of the cationic polymer, PEI on the surface of silicon dioxide is the key factor in the suppression of oxideRR. The adsorbed PEI presumably prevents the dissolution of silicondioxide into the solution. Ceria abrasive surfaces contains Ce 3+which is believed to be chemically active, as described later in the section on reactivity of ceria. It seems that the Ce3+on the surface of ceria abrasivea inter- acts with the suboxide formed on the silicon nitride \ufb01lms forming a complex, which consists of Ce-O-Si structures, and pulls the subox-ide during polishing, presumably since Ce-O-Si structures are muchstronger that Si-O-Si structures (Fig. 2c). The suboxide is regenerated by hydrolysis and this removal process continues. The silicon nitride RR is suppressed when the reactivity of Ce 3+on the ceria abrasive surface is blocked and/or the hydrolysis reaction of the nitride conver- sion to silicon dioxide is hindered due to the adsorption of differentadditives. 65 Using zirconia- and silica-based dispersions, high silicon nitride and low silicon dioxide removal rates were reported by Natarajan et al.66Without any additives, zirconia gave a reverse selectivity of 78 at pH 4, while 2 wt% arginine in a 10 wt% silica slurry at pH 8 gave a reverse selectivity of 7.66The exact mechanism of silicon nitride polishing with these slurries was not explained. Veera Danduet al. 67showed that dispersions of silica particles functionalized with phosphate groups give higher nitride RR and low oxide RR, as may beexpected from the use of hot phosphoric acid to etch nitride selectivelyover oxide. Using diethylphosphato-ethyltriethoxysilane (DPTS) asthe precursor, the functionalized silica particles were synthesized inalcohol media to prevent hydrolysis and condensation of DPTS. Theunreacted DPTS was removed from the dispersion by dialysis andthen diluted with deionized water, while the isopropyl alcohol andethanol formed during this process were removed using a rotovap.DPTS molecules have an ethanol group on one end and a phosphategroup on the other end. During polishing, the phosphate end group ofthe DPTS molecule tethered to a silica abrasive reacts with the siliconnitride surface resulting in high RRs of silicon nitride \ufb01lm (Figure 4). Characteristics of Ceria Abrasives Nature and type of ceria abrasives.\u2014 As was mentioned earlier, the type of ceria abrasives used in formulating a slurry can have aprofound effect on both rate selectivity and defectivity, as well as itcolloidal properties. 12For example, Kim et al.68prepared ceria abra- sives by calcining cerium carbonate at 650\u25e6C for 4 h (sample A) and 6h (sample B), milled the particles and evaluated their performance. Slurry A yielded lower oxide RR, more number of scratches and apoorer within wafer non-uniformity. The XRD based grain size ofparticles A was smaller than that of B, but the agglomerate size of Ain slurry was larger than that of B. They suggested that at the shorterduration (4 h), the conversion was incomplete and resulted in lowercrystallinity which led to easy breakdown of the particles. The smallerparticles agglomerated causing lower oxide RR and worse defectivity.In another report, Kim et al. 69calcined cerium carbonate at 650\u25e6C for 4 h under controlled air \ufb02ow conditions. The air \ufb02ow conditions during synthesis were 35, 5 and 0 m3/h for samples A, B and C respec- tively. The particles were subsequently wet milled and dispersed in slurry at pH 8, with poly (methyl methacrylate) surfactant. Based onCMP experiments, they reported that particles synthesized at loweroxygen concentration included hexagonal structure (Ce 2O3), broke down more easily during milling and agglomerated to larger sizes inslurries, and yielded lower oxide RR and higher defectivity (in terms of residual particles and number of scratches). The effect of two step calcination and milling with different sized beads (0.2 to 0.8 mm) onremoval rate and defectivity was also investigated. 70The two step cal- cination (680\u25e6C / 580\u25e6C) and milling with 0.3 mm beads resulted in a slurry with minimal defects and acceptable selectivity (\u223c37). Theseresults suggest that synthesis method of the ceria particles has a strongeffect on polishing performance. Earlier, Carter and Johns 29,49measured the removal rates of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride in 0.5 wt% ceria (mean particle size of\u223c120 nm) based slurries with many organic additives, at pH 5. Amongthe additives, glutamic acid, picolinic acid, 4-hydroxybenxoic acid andImidazole showed a selectivity of more than 100 while slurries withproline showed a selectivity of only 3. This contrasts sharply withthe earlier reports by Srinivasan et al. 42\u201346and America and Babu28 that showed much higher selectivity at pH 6 and higher. They usedcalcined ceria particles (avg. size \u223c180 nm, Ferro corp.) while Carter and Johns did not report the synthesis method. The difference between these results suggests that the synthesis method and/or the purity ofthe abrasives may have played a role. Praveen et al. 71also showed that the calcination temperature of synthesized ceria particles and the associated crystallite size impact ) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

XRD analyses of the abrasives suggest that the crystallite size is positively correlated to the calcination temperature. Similarly, Kim et al.72found that the oxide RRs obtained using cal- cined ceria abrasives (crystallite size \u223c46 nm) were higher than those with precipitated particles (average size \u223c34 nm) and assigned the enhanced RR to the larger crystallite size of the calcined ceria. Recently, Doi et al.73observed that the addition of picolonic acid to colloidal ceria (mean dia \u223c69 nm) enhanced the removal rates from \u223c150 nm/min to 370 nm/min at pH 4.5, but lower than the \u223c400 nm/min obtained with almost the same size calcined ceria (Figure 6). Since the particle sizes were the same for both colloidal and calcinedceria, the synthesis method appears to strongly in\ufb02uence the oxideremoval behavior.

Silicon dioxide RR in slurries containing 0.25 wt% ceria abra- sives synthesized at different calcination temperatures. Adapted from Praveen et al.71on the polished silicon dioxide \ufb01lms increased when picolinic acid was added. They speculated that picolinic acid might assist the chemicalreaction between Ce 3+and silicon dioxide rather than increase the number of Ce3+on the ceria particles or in the slurry. Not only the method of preparation but also the associated impuri- ties in the ceria particles seem to play a role on STI performance. For example, Praveen et al.71compared the selectivity obtained in slurries containing either L-proline or L-glutamic acid with ceria abrasives from three different sources: Sigma Aldrich (ceria-SA), Sodiff, Korea(ceria-S) and ceria prepared by calcination of Ce 2(CO 3)3followed by milling (ceria-CM). The ceria-SA and ceria-S abrasives, but not ceria-CM, were found to contain La as an impurity. The results showed thatwith L-glutamic acid as the additive, all the slurries yielded high se-lectivity, while with L-proline, only slurries with pure ceria abrasivesyielded high selectivity. La doping in CeO 2is expected to increase the oxygen vacancies and also \u2018pin\u2019 them, restraining the vacancies from migrating.74Gillis et al.75reported that La atoms doped in CeO 2tend to migrate to the surface. Taken together, these \ufb01ndings suggest that La dopingwill increase the oxygen vacancies at the surface and those vacancieswould not migrate, thus permanently changing the surface state. Theincrease in oxygen vacancies on the particle surface would tend toincrease the fraction of Ce 3+on the surface. Thus it appears that both the synthesis method and purity level of ceria abrasive can strongly in\ufb02uence its polishing characteristics. Reactivity of ceria.\u2014 Ceria based slurries are believed to chemi- cally interact with SiO 2and yield high RR, and the initially, Ce4+was proposed as the reactive species.13Subsequent investigations suggest that Ce3+is likely to be the reactive species. The relevant reports are summarized below. Based on UV-visible absorption spectra, Veera Dandu et al.15identi\ufb01ed that the primary species on the ceria surface responsible for the high reactivity with silica are likely to be Ce3+ ) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

Silicon dioxide RR of slurries with cal- cined ceria and colloidal ceria (with and without additives). Adapted from Dio et al.73 species. The absorption spectra of Ce3+and Ce4+show clearly differ- ent signatures and are dependent on pH. They analyzed the \ufb01ltrates prepared from ceria dispersions and showed that the ions present insolution are Ce 3+. In addition, when additives such as PVP or PAD (which suppress oxide RR in ceria slurries) are present in the slurry,the spectra showed that the \ufb01ltrate did not contain Ce 3+. This shows that Ce3+is the species likely to interact with oxide \ufb01lm, and that PVP and PAD block the Ce3+sites, thereby inhibiting oxide removal. Recently, Veera Dandu et al.76measured the oxide and nitride RRs in ceria slurries with controlled dissolved oxygen content (DOC) inthe pH range of 2 to 12 (Figures 7aand7b). At pH <4, the oxide and nitride RRs were low, regardless of DOC. In the pH range of 4\u201312, the oxide and nitride RRs were high and more or less independentof pH, for a given DOC. In this pH range, the oxide and nitride RRsdecreased with an increase in DOC. In another report, Manivannanand Ramanathan 77showed that the addition of H 2O2to ceria slurries caused a drastic reduction in oxide and nitride RRs in the pH range of 7\u201310. Both these sets of results could be explained if Ce3+is the active site, which would be converted to Ce4+(assumed to be less active) at higher DOC or by the addition of H 2O2. They also showed that if the ceria treated with H 2O2is \ufb01ltered and redispersed in water (without adding H 2O2), then the oxide and nitride RR were not suppressed, indicating that the conversion of Ce3+to Ce4+in an oxidizing environment is reversible. Several published reports about the role of oxygen vacancies sup- port this proposition. Deshpande et al.78and Dutta et al.7,9among others, have shown that ceria nanoparticles have Ce3+on the surface and that oxygen vacancies drive the formation of Ce3+from Ce4+. Based on DFT calculations, Preda et al.80proposed that, on the sur- face of a ceria particle, a Ce3+site with an oxygen vacancy can interactwith molecular oxygen and can possibly form two species, a Ce4+su- peroxo species or a Ce3+peroxo species (Figure 8). With increasing DOC in the slurry, it is likely that the Ce3+sites with oxygen vacancies are converted to one of these two forms, leading to a reduction in the RR since only the Ce3+with an oxygen vacancy, and not the super- oxo and peroxo species, is the reactive site. Using DFT corrected for onsite coulomb interactions, Yeriskin and Nolan81studied the effect of La doping on ceria surface. They showed that La3+substitution of Ce4+results in an oxygen vacancy, which results in the production of one Ce3+. Patil et al.82synthesized ceria nanoparticles ( \u223c3t o5 nm) with controlled La and Nd doping by a microemulsion process.The particles were analyzed using XRD and Raman spectroscopy andthey showed that the lattice parameter and defect concentration in-creased with La doping. They proposed that substitution of Ce 4+by La3+causes introduction of oxygen vacancies and partial reduction of neighboring Ce4+to Ce3+. These results are similar to those of Gillis et al.75with larger ceria particles. Modi\ufb01cation of ceria particles.\u2014 Even though ceria abrasives are prone to generate more post-CMP defects compared to colloidal silica,83they have certain inherent advantages such as higher through- put, lower particle loading, initial cost, and perhaps lower post-CMP waste disposal costs. Hence, novel design concepts that can minimize the challenges without sacri\ufb01cing the advantages are continually be- ing developed and evaluated. One example, though for silica particles,is the phosphate functionalized particles described earlier. 67A more important example is the usage of slurries containing a mixture ofceria and other abrasives as well as core/shell type particles madeof an external ceria coating. Some examples are described below todemonstrate the potential of such an approach. 0200400600800 2468 1 0 1 2Oxide RR (nm/min) pHDOC ~8.6 mg/L DOC ~12.1 mg/L DOC~16.6 mg/L 0255075100125150 2468 1 0 1 2Nitride RR (nm/min) pHDOC~8.6 mg/L DOC~12.1 mg/L DOC~16.6 mg/L (b) (a) Figure 7.

Possible reaction pathways showing the formation of peroxo and superoxo complexes of Ce3+at higher DOC values. The concentration of Ce3+species with the oxygen vacancy, the reactive sites, drops in the presence of O 2. Hence oxide and nitride RR decrease when DOC is increased. Jindal et al.84showed that the RRs of oxide increased with ceria coated alumina-based slurries when compared to RRs obtained with either ceria- or silica-based dispersions, but defectivity data were notreported. Lee et al. 85synthesized silica particles coated with ceria and found that the oxide RR obtained using a ceria coated silica slurry wassigni\ufb01cantly higher than that in the pure abrasive slurries. Lu et al. 86 evaluated the polishing performance of silica, ceria and hematite abra-sives, in single abrasive mode, (binary) mixed abrasive mode and innano-particle coated abrasive mode. The ceria particles were relativelysmall (\u223c20 nm), while the silica particles were spherical ( \u223c400 nm). Hematite particles were synthesized in two shapes, viz. ellipsoidal (\u223c400 nm) and cubic (\u223c750 nm). Nanosized ceria and silica ( \u223c20 nm) abrasives yielded negligible oxide RRs and slurries with only sil- ica or hematite showed very low (17-18 nm/min) oxide RRs. Hematitebased mixed abrasives, on the other hand, showed higher oxide RRs.Silica or hematite abrasives coated with ceria produced even higheroxide RRs. They also showed that adding ceria abrasives to a \ufb01xedabrasive pad can dramatically increase the oxide RR. The authorssuggested that the mixed abrasives and the coated abrasives synergis-tically utilize the reactivity of the ceria and the increased contact areabetween the wafer and the abrasive to enhance the oxide RRs. Park et al. 87investigated the oxide RR in zirconia and silica mixed abrasive slurries. Dilution of pure silica slurry resulted in lowering of oxide RR but addition of zirconia increased the oxide RR to originalvalues. The WIW uniformity of the RR was also comparable to theoriginal silica slurry results. The main advantage of this mixed abra-sive system was the lower cost compared to the original silica slurrycost. Armini et al. 83synthesized two types of composite abrasives with a 300 nm polymer core coated \u223c14 nm ceria particles, one achieved with a silane coupling agents and the other with electrostatic interactionsbetween the core and the shell. They reported that the two compositeabrasive-based slurries exhibit different RRs, probably due to thedifference in morphology and surface composition. More importantly,they showed that these composite particles exhibit lower defects whencompared to conventional slurries, probably due to spring like effect ofthe softer elastic core during polishing. Lee et al. 88evaluated a slurry with ceria and silica abrasives and showed that it gave reasonable oxide RRs, acceptable RR selectivity, good slurry stability, and lowsurface defects. While the reduction in defect level is important, otherfactors such as slurry stability, shelf-life and performance consistencyalso need to be evaluated before these mixed or composite abrasivesare employed in production. There are several other reports of usingmixed abrasive or core/shell particles in slurry formulation, for STICMP as well as metal and barrier CMP. 89\u201398CMP of Patterned STI Structures While planarization of patterned structures is all important, most of the published data are from blanket wafer \ufb01lm polishing and, as is widely known, these rates do not carry over to patterned structures.This poses a real challenge for developing in a cost-effective mannerslurries for planarizing STI structures. Also, the results of polish-ing pattern wafers using different slurries, while available to mostpracticing engineers in the industry, are not widely available in thepublic domain, undoubtedly due to the associated intellectual propertyrights. As stated earlier, extent of nitride and \ufb01eld oxide loss, dish-ing, response to almost always required overpolish, WIW and WIDuniformity, and defects - and not just selectivity - are some of the crit-ical metrics for evaluating the performance of a slurry in conjunctionwith several other associate process variables. A few publications doaddress some of these issues and are summarized below. Kim et al. 99polished both blanket and patterned wafers using silica based slurries and reported that the oxide removal rates in both are strongly correlated. Later Kim et al.100employed a high selectivity sil- ica based slurry, developed in house, to polish patterned structures and obtained signi\ufb01cantly less variability in post CMP thickness valuesby using end point detection based on monitoring the motor currentinstead of polishing for a predetermined time and found that there is a strong correlation between the two RRs. In both cases, the selectivity data were not reported. Lim et al. 101evaluated the effect of ceria abrasive size on the dishing and step height reduction during STI CMP. Ceria abrasivesof three different particles sizes (primary particle sizes of 45 nm,175 nm and 225 nm) were dispersed in DI water at pH 6.7. Thedishing and step height reduction in trenches of about 10 micronwidth were measured using atomic force microscopy. The step heightreduction was less initially but it increased at longer polishing times.This was attributed to the abrasives particles trapped in the trenches.The slurry with larger particles yielded quicker step height reductionand larger removal rates. At suf\ufb01ciently long times, all the slurriesresulted in complete step height reduction. However, the extent ofdishing increased with over polishing time, as expected, and it alsoincreased slightly with the size of the abrasive. Merricks et al. 102compared the removal rates of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride as a function of time in ceria based slurries with two different additives, an unspeci\ufb01ed amino acid and poly acrylic acid(PAA). In both case, the selectivity on pattern wafers was lower thanwhat would be predicted from blanket \ufb01lm data. They found that, intheir case, after the initial nitride \ufb01lm exposure, another 30s overpolishwas needed to clear the oxide from the rest of the wafer during which ) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

    "ECS Journal of Solid State Science and Technology ,4(11) P5029-P5039 (2015) P5037 time oxide loss continued with the PAA slurry but not with the amino acid slurry. Hence, the dishing was considerably higher and WIWand WID considerably worse for the PAA containing slurry. With theamino acid based slurry, removal of the silicon nitride \ufb01lm occurredonly in the initial \u223c6s or so, supposedly the time required for the amino acid functional groups to equilibrate on the nitride surface. There wasvery little oxide as well as nitride loss afterwards, leading to a 1:1RR ratio and, hence, no increase in dishing and no detrimental effectsfrom overpolishing on WIW an WID uniformity, characteristics thatare highly desirable in a slurry for pattern structure planarization. Yang et al. 103compared the polishing performance of three kinds of ceria and four kinds of silica slurries. The effect of particle sizeand shape on the step height reduction of rectangular ( \u223c100 nm size) and saw tooth ( \u223c500 nm pitch) patterns was studied. Based on the analysis of the results, they concluded that smaller sized andspherically shaped ceria particles are more effective in step height reduction. Euvrard et al. 60evaluated the effect of selectivity on dishing, but using slurries with low selectivity (\u223c1). They compared the results from blanket wafers with those from patterned wafers and concluded that the selectivity is higher for the patterned wafers. However, sincethe mechanism of \ufb01lm removal in a high selectivity slurry differsvastly from that of a low selectivity slurry, this conclusions maynot apply to high selectivity slurries. Kim et al. 104showed that step height reduction, or planarization, was better with ceria-based slurriescontaining proline and serine over that obtained with glutamine andamino butyric acid. They proposed that a stronger interaction betweenthe oxide and proline or serine, which they calculated from standardDLVO theory, is the cause of improved step height reduction. Liao et al. 105investigated the importance of pad surface topogra- phy in STI CMP using patterned wafers with varying pattern densities (10% to 90%), all with 100 micron pitch. They employed two condi-tioners and a mixture of commercial slurries from Hitachi. All yieldedroughly similar RRs but vastly different dishing and erosion values.They suggested that the conditioners that generate more and sharperpad asperities can increase dishing and erosion by more than 100%in most features, presumably due to the direct contact of the downfeatures with the sharp asperities. Seo et al. 106found that the step height changes can be tuned by controlling the adhesive force between ceria abrasives andthe polyurethane pad when they used picolinic acid based ceriadispersions at pH 4.5 to polish 500 nm wide patterns. The step height reduction, measured as a function of polish time in slurries with and without picolinic acid, was signi\ufb01cantly better in slurries withpicolinic acid. They proposed that picolinic acid covers the ceriaabrasive surface and helps with the attachment of ceria particles to thepad, which helps in the reduction of step height. Later, Seo et al. 107 investigated the effect of adding both PAA and poly (ethylene glycol)(PEG) to ceria based slurries at pH 5 to polish patterned wafers with100 micron wide lines at various pattern densities (37.5% to 75%)and showed that the combination enhanced selectivity and reduceddishing. Without the additives, the selectivity was moderate ( \u223c56) and the dishing was approximately 800 \u00c5 and 200 \u00c5, respectively, forlines with a pattern density of 37.5% and 75%, and were reduced to about 600 \u00c5 and 100 \u00c5, respectively, in the presence of 0.8 wt% PAA and 0.3 wt% PEG. They suggested that hydrogen bonding facilitatesthe adsorption of PAA on silicon nitride which suppresses nitride re-moval and enhances selectivity as well as the formation of PAA-PEG\u201cinterpolymer complexes\u201d that reduce dishing by preventing oxideabrasion. Clearly, the data needed to evaluate the performance of an STI slurry, indeed, any CMP process slurry for that matter, are more ex- tensive and differ in many ways from those that can be obtained fromblanket wafer \ufb01lm polishing. They also depend critically on the na-ture and morphology of the polishing pad, the polishing tool and theassociated tool parameters. As such, enormous resources, includingthose needed to cover the cost of expensive patterned wafers, have tobe allocated to validate and accept a slurry for large volume manu-facturing and can indeed act as a barrier to entry for newer candidateslurries.Current Challenges While enormous progress has been achieved as described above and continues, several challenges remain. Only a couple of these \u2013 defect reduction and new dielectric materials - are addressed below. Defect reduction.\u2014 CMP (dielectric or metal) process-induced de- fects can be classi\ufb01ed broadly as micro scratches, gouges and pits, dishing, residual particles and organic residues. Any of these defectsin STI CMP can result in yield loss and, hence, their reduction, andpreferably elimination, is a key challenge. 108Indeed,this is an over- arching and overriding concern for maintaining yields and remains atthe top of the list of performance metrics. An effective CMP processis one that minimizes defects and facilitates post-CMP processingto remove all contaminants from the post-polished surfaces. A typi-cal commercial ceria-based slurry may contain large and/or irregularshaped particles which are more likely to cause many defects. Pointof use \ufb01ltration can prevent \u201clarge particles\u201d from reaching the pol- ish tool or the wafer surface and help in defect reduction 109,110and, consequently, online real time particle monitoring and feedback has gained considerable importance. Since it is known that slurries basedon small and relatively narrow size-dispersed spherical ceria particlescan lower defects, a judicious selection of ceria particle size and/orperhaps using a \u201cmixture\u201d of narrow sized silica and ceria can alsohelp in reducing the defect levels without sacri\ufb01cing oxide RR andselectivity. 83,111 High selectivity or nitride rate suppression is, in principle, needed only at the last stage of removing the oxide overburden when silicon nitride surface is \ufb01rst exposed and overpolishing is used to removeresidual oxide. In Cu CMP, the process is usually carried out in twosteps: the \ufb01rst stage CMP when the bulk of the Cu is removed andthe second stage soft landing step to remove the residual Cu followedby or concurrently removing the barrier layer. Similarly, it may bepossible to remove the bulk of the silicon dioxide using a ceria basedslurry with high oxide rate irrespective of the nitride rate and the\ufb01nal polish may be performed with a slurry with moderate or highselectivity that can minimize dishing, result in a good WIW and WIDuniformity, low defect levels and a facile post CMP clean process.In any case, since any residual oxide will prevent the etching of theunderlying nitride and hence interfere with the exposure of the activesilicon region, some degree of overpolishing is commonly used, butat the cost of increased \ufb01lm thickness nonuniformity. Another optionis to remove the residual oxide using a dilute HF etch but, as is well known, this will grow and expand/decorate even the smallest of the scratches that may be present in the oxide \u2013 a critical concern. The drive toward \u2018green chemicals\u2019 leads to utilization of bio- compatible additives in the slurry but this can simultaneously lead tobio-contamination in the slurry storage or transport channels and/orpolishing equipment and hence on the wafer. This challenge is usu-ally overcome by including biocides in the slurry. Additionally, as theuse of smaller and smaller abrasive particles is gaining importance,their potential environmental importance must be investigated and allrisks must be eliminated. 112Since slurry formulations remain propri- etary and dynamic, there is a need to collaboratively develop newapproaches to properly dispose the used slurry to eliminate any riskin the work place or the environment. 112The potential toxicity of the abrasives by themselves and in their modi\ufb01ed form in the post-CMPdispersions, especially when they are at the nanoscale, is a seriousconcern and mandates stringent safe handling procedures that mustbecome an integral part of their use. Dielectrics other than silicon dioxide.\u2014 Silicon carbonitride has been evaluated as a dielectric diffusion barrier 113and its incorporation requires a CMP step with a high silicon carbontride RR and a low silicon dioxide RR. It is possible that similar materials such as siliconoxynitride or silicon oxycarbide may also be used as the dielectricin different STI integration schemes. 113Introduction of these or other new materials will require new slurries as well as reoptimization of theentire process recipe.

Also, for materials such as silicon oxynitride used with an underlying siliconnitride stop layer, the difference in optical properties may not besuf\ufb01ciently large for the optical method to identify the end point. Onemay have to rely on \ufb02uorescence 115or temperature116as a parameter to identify the end point. The challenges discussed here represent only the tip of the iceberg. Many more challenges exist but given the historical evolution of theCMP processes, the industry has been ef\ufb01cient and highly innovativein overcoming many such challenges at earlier nodes and there is noreason to believe that the trend will not persist. Conclusions CMP is ubiquitous in the semiconductor industry and has become increasingly integral to an ever growing number of process integrationschemes involving novel materials. Speci\ufb01cally, STI process integra-tion employs the CMP process to planarize the trench dielectric usingusually a ceria based slurry and process combinations that generate arelatively high oxide rate polish rate with minimal nitride loss or highrate selectivity, as well as reduced dishing, erosion, WIW and WID nonuniformity and other defects. The desired high selectivity is achieved mostly with ceria based slurries admixed with suitable additives. The additives are essential to suppress the nitride RRs while maintaining the oxide RRs at ac-ceptable levels. The results presented in patents and published articlesreviewed here have brought some clarity to the understanding of thenitride rate suppression mechanism. Additives such as amino acids,if available in suf\ufb01cient quantities, and at the correct pH range wherethey remain protonated, can adsorb on the silicon nitride surface andprevent the hydrolysis of the silicon nitride surface and reduce itsremoval rate. Ceria chemically interacts with the SiO 2surface, and although the reactivity of ceria toward the silicon dioxide has been well known,the actual mechanism is only now emerging. Based on many recentexperiments as well several \ufb01rst principle calculations, it appears thatCe 3+stabilized by an oxygen vacancy on the surface of ceria particles is the primary reactive species that interacts and polishes the oxide \ufb01lm. Among other results, the reduction in silicon dioxide and siliconnitride RR at various pH levels, with increasing dissolved oxygen con-tent of ceria slurries suggests a role for molecular oxygen to transformthese Ce 3+species into less reactive ones. The ceria abrasive synthesis process conditions that impact crystallite size, morphology and purityhave a strong effect on the polishing characteristics. Also, precipitatedand calcined ceria behave differently. The abrasive purity also appearsto be important in determining the selectivity. Impurities such as La in the abrasive can drastically change the polishing behavior, at least in case of some additives such as proline. All these parameters seemto impact the concentration of the surface Ce 3species and, because of it, the oxide polish rate. Ceria based slurries can generate more defects than silica based slurries, but they also yield higher selectivity and removal rates thatenable high wafer throughputs. Innovations such as cost-effectivemonodispersed and/or smaller and spherical ceria abrasives, or theusage of mixed, composite, core/shell or other functional abrasiveslurries with appropriate additive/s can assist in reducing the defectlevels while maintaining throughput and selectivity. Introduction ofnew materials such as silicon oxynitride, silicon carbonitride or siliconoxycarbide in the STI structure complicates slurry and process devel-opment as well as end point detection. A high silicon nitride RR witha low silicon dioxide RR (i.e. reverse selectivity) is useful in certainprocess steps, for example, during the front end 3D-gate processing.Such reverse selectivity can be achieved by adding suitable chemicalssuch as PEI, PDADMAC, PVP and PAD. The additives such as PVPor PAD can block the active Ce 3+sites on the abrasive and suppress the removal of silicon dioxide. Also, silica abrasives can be modi\ufb01edby grafting phosphate functional groups and the resulting abrasivesselectivity polish nitride over oxide, mainly because of the interactionof the phosphate group with the nitride surface, bust cost is a barrier. Other major challenges facing the industry in the usage of high selectivity STI CMP slurries include the ability to predict performance of patterned structures with different pattern densities and featuresizes from blanket wafer \ufb01lm rate data and reduction in defect levelsincluding WIW and WID non-uniformity, end point detection andtreatment and disposal of used slurry. The effect of nanoparticles inthe slurry on the environment is an emerging and growing concernrequiring effective treatment and disposal of the ef\ufb02uent from theCMP process. In conclusion, CMP technology, in general, has undergone remark- able evolution in sophistication, complexity and utilization over the years while remaining far ahead of the understanding of the underly-ing fundamental principles \u2013 something that is not likely to change inthe near future.

It is widely believed that the trivalent cerium ions (Ce3\u0087) on the surface of cerium oxide particles can form Ce-O-Si bonds with silicon dioxide dielectric. Therefore, the application of cerium oxide in the medium CMP process has been widely studied. The particle size and morphology of cerium oxide particles, the concentration of Ce3\u0087and surface modification will all affect the performance of SiO2 dielectric CMP. In addition, due to the presence of the barrier layer of silicon nitride, the selectivity of the removal rates of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride is also an important factor to be considered in the CMP process. The current research on cerium oxide abrasives mainly focuses on the modification and doping of abrasive particles, as well as the control of particle size. In addition, the presence of Ce-O-Si bonds leads to the adsorption of cerium oxide particles on the surface of the medium after polishing, and the problem of particle adsorption is particularly prominent when using small particle size cerium oxide to reduce defects. Researchers have also done a lot of work to achieve better surface quality.

This work mainly reviews the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide, the factors affecting the CMP rate and the improvement methods. In the aspect of CMP cleaning, the introduction of additives, water cleaning, chemical cleaning and other cleaning methods are summarized. On this basis, some suggestions were proposed to provide valuable references for the STI CMP and post cleaning based on cerium oxide abrasive. 1.Introduction In advanced integrated circuit manufacturing processes, dielectric materials are commonly used for electrolyte insulation, surface passiv - ation, diffusion masking [1], and reducing RC delay [2]. The dielectric materials used mainly include silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, high k/low k dielectrics, etc. Silicon dioxide is widely used in the field of integrated circuit manufacturing due to its low cost, easy preparation, excellent dielectric properties, and good process compatibility. It is usually used as an insulation layer, dielectric isolation, protective layer, passivation layer, gate oxide layer, or diffusion mask layer. With the development of NAND (Negative-AND) flash memory technology, it is difficult for planar lithography technology to continue to be suitable for the expo- nential growth of sensing area. The 3D stacking technology using the etching process has been widely adopted due to its advantages of high density, good performance and low cost. Fig. 1 shows (a) pipe-shaped bit-cost-scalable (P-BiCS) and (b) terabit-cell-array transistor (TCAT) for 3D NAND, respectively. Typically, silicon nitride is used as a charge trapping layer (CTL) to store charges, while silicon oxide or alumina is used as a barrier oxide (BOX) layer [3]. As can be seen from the NAND structure, isolation processes are essential. The traditional local oxida - tion of silicon (LOCOS) process is a commonly used isolation technology in the manufacturing of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). However, the conventional LOCOS process is greatly limited due to the fact that oxygen diffused into silicon dioxide will come into contact with the silicon on the side, leading to field oxygen erosion in the direction of the active area and causing the \"beak effect\" [4]. This problem is well solved by the shallow trench isolation (STI) process, mainly including etching grooves on the silicon substrate, oxide filling and oxide flattening to achieve isolation of the active area, as shown in Fig. 2 [5]. Because STI technology can achieve smaller isolation spacing and superior latch protection, it is widely used in technology nodes of 0.25 \u00b5m and below. In the STI process, the flattening of oxides is a particularly important part, as shown in Fig. 2(d). At this point, the silicon nitride on the silicon surface acts as a barrier layer to prevent damage to important surfaces during planarization and epitaxial growth processes. When performing oxide flattening, it is necessary to retain silicon nitride while removing the silica. Therefore, the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process of STI should not only consider the surface morphology and polishing Fig. 1.Y-Z cross view of CT-based NAND [3]. Fig. 2.A schematic representation of the STI Process. Note that the dielectric, denoted by D, may be pure or other forms of SiO2.

As the feature size of semiconductor technology continues to decrease, STI technology requires abrasives for CMP (as shown in Fig. 2d) process to have high selectivity and low defect levels while guaranteeing high polishing rates. In order to meet the process requirements, the removal rate selection ratio of silica and silicon nitride needs to be 30:1. In the absence of any additives, the removal rate se- lection ratio of silica and silicon nitride polished with the slurry con- taining cerium oxide, alumina, silica and silicon carbide abrasives was compared [6]. At the same speed and pressure, the slurry containing cerium oxide abrasive can achieve the highest removal rate of silica, and the highest selection ratio of silica and silicon nitride. Therefore, for the STI process, cerium oxide abrasive becomes a preferred choice for the oxide planarization. Cerium oxide is a fluorite oxide with a face-centered cubic crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 3 [7], with each cerium atom surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. Since cerium ions in cerium oxide can finish reversible electron transfer between the two valence states (Ce3\u0087and Ce4\u0087), oxygen vacancies are formed in the lattice, that is, the appearance of Ce3\u0087must be accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies, which contributes to the formation of CeO 2 and CeO 2\u0000x. This property also endows cerium oxide nanoparticles with redox ability, which can be used as catalysts for oxidation or reduction reaction. The strength of redox capacity is closely related to the concentration of oxygen va- cancies, which can be reflected by the determination of Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087in cerium oxide, or quantified by oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [8], which is the number of moles of oxygen released per gram of the initial ma- terial. The redox capacity of cerium oxide can be controlled by changing its surface properties, particle size, particle shape, and preparation process. Due to its redox properties, cerium oxide can be used in catalysts [9], fuel cell electrolytes [10], automobile exhaust cleaning agents [11], biomedicine [12], chemical mechanical polishing [13] and other fields. With the decreasing of feature size in integrated circuits, the re- quirements for the removal rate of oxide layer and surface quality are also increasing. How to obtain a wafer surface with fewer defects and lower roughness under the premise of high polishing rate and selectivity is a problem worth exploring. In addition, the removal of residue cerium oxide particles after polishing is also the focus of current research. Because residual particle will lead to uneven morphology of the micro areas on the wafer surface, affecting lithography accuracy, and even chip failure. How to remove cerium oxide particles without damaging the wafer surface is also one of the key issues that need to be paid attention to. In this article, the research progress of cerium oxide in the field of CMP was reviewed. Firstly, the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide is introduced, with the formation of Ce-O-Si bonds being the main role. Subsequently, the effects of particle size, the ratio of Ce3\u0087to Ce4\u0087and surface modification of ceria on polishing performance were analyzed, with a focus on methods to improve the polishing performance, including improving the removal rate selection ratio of silica to silicon nitride, as well as solving the existing problems of dishing, surface uniformity after polishing. Finally, the current cleaning methods for dielectric materials polished with cerium oxide were introduced, mainly including acid cleaning solution and alkaline cleaning solution, as well as their improvement methods. This will provide reference for improving the performance of dielectric CMP and post-polishing cleaning based on cerium oxide abrasive in IC manufacturing processes. 2.Correlation mechanism between CeO 2 abrasive and SiO2 dielectric layer The particle size, Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087value and surface properties of ceria abrasives will affect polishing performance such as the polishing rate, surface morphology, and selectivity. Therefore, the research progress in these aspects is summarized and suggestions for improving polishing performance are proposed. CMP is a particularly important part of integrated circuit manufacturing process. CMP treatment of wafer surface can greatly improve the flatness of wafer, which will affect the subsequent process. The process of polishing the fused silica surface with abrasives and the scratches caused by abrasives are shown in Fig. 4[14] . The fused silica adhered to the polishing head is placed on the polishing pad under a certain pressure, and the polishing head rotates at a constant speed, while the polishing slurry drops on the polishing pad at a certain speed. In this process, the abrasive will leave certain scratches on the fused silica, which should be avoided as much as possible during the polishing process. The shape and hardness of the abrasive play a decisive role in the removal effect and scratch state of the material. Therefore, it is very important to find an appropriate abrasive shape to improve the polish - ing performance. The hardness of cerium oxide is 5.5, which is much lower than that of diamond, alumina, silicon dioxide, etc. From the mechanical point of view, it is not suitable for polishing silicon dioxide, but from the chemical perspective, it will catalyze the hydration of the surface of silicon dioxide, which is very dependent on water. The interaction be- tween the SiO2 surface and water is one of the main steps of polishing process. Hydration steps are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) [7]: \u0000SiO 2\u0087H2O\u2192\u0000Si\u0000OH\u2192\u0000Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087H\u0087(1) \u0000Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087Ce\u0000OH\u2192\u0000Si\u0000O\u0000Ce\u0000\u0087OH\u0000(2) The hydrated silica film is much softer than before, making it more suitable for removal. At the same time, due to the low hardness of the material, it is not easy to scratch the surface of the material in the pol- ishing process. In 1990, COOK et al. [15] first proposed the concept of Fig. 3.Structural analysis of ceria crystals and unit cells. Eight-fold coordinated cerium atoms (yellow) with four-fold coordinated oxygen atoms (red) in ceria crystals (a and b) and the primitive unit cell (c) [7]. X. Han et al.",

Cerium oxide has chemical teeth, which can accelerate the breaking of chemical bonds on the surface of silicon dioxide and the removal rate of reaction products is greater than the formation rate of surface compound. So, cerium oxide is a good abrasive for silica CMP. The following is a detailed introduction to the principle of removing silica with cerium oxide. The adsorption of cerium oxide on the surface of silicon oxide in- volves multiple aspects, and research methods mainly include immer - sion and polishing. Immersion refers to soaking a silica sample in cerium oxide slurry, so that the surface of the sample is contaminated with cerium oxide. Compared with immersion, polishing also involves pres- sure and rotation friction related to the physical properties of the pol- ishing pad. Therefore, for these two methods, the adsorption degree of cerium oxide on the surface of samples is different, and it is expected that the samples obtained through polishing will adsorb more cerium oxide. Han K-M et al. [16] found through experiments that when using the immersion method to contaminate samples, the samples were more seriously polluted at lower pH; but for polishing, the samples adsorbed more particles when pH was high. And in general, the polishing process produces more particle adsorption than the soaking process. Therefore, in order to study the action mechanism of cerium oxide in the polishing process more accurately, the following discussion mainly focuses on the contamination of samples by polishing. Cerium oxide is adsorbed on silica surface by electrostatic and chemical forces. The pH value at the Zeta potential of 0 is called the isoelectric point (IEP). Within the pH range of 3\u201311, the Zeta potential measurements of cerium oxide and TEOS (Tetraethyl orthosilicate) are shown in Fig. 5[16] : The IEP of cerium oxide is between 7 and 8. The Zeta potential is positive when the pH is lower than the IEP, while it is negative when the pH is greater than the IEP. The Zeta potential of TEOS is always negative and becomes more negative as the pH increases in the range of pH 3\u201311. Therefore, when the pH is lower than the IEP of cerium oxide, i.e., at low pH, there is a large electrostatic attraction between cerium oxide and silicon dioxide, while at high pH, there is a strong electrostatic repulsion between the two. In polishing process, there are more particles adsorbed on the surface of samples when the pH value is high, indicating that the effect of electrostatic repulsion can be ignored, and chemisorption may be the main reason. Under different pH conditions, the existence states of cerium oxide and silicon oxide are different. At lower pH, cerium oxide exists in the form of Ce-OH2\u0087, while silicon oxide exists in the form of Si-OH2\u0087. At higher pH, cerium oxide exists in the form of Ce-OH or Ce- O-, while the silicon oxide exists in the form of Si-OH or Si-O- [17]. The acid-base equilibrium formula of the oxides of cerium oxide [15] and silicon oxide [18] under different acid-base conditions is as follows, where pHpzc represents the pH of the solution at the zero charge point of cerium oxide: Ce\u0000OH\u0087 2\u2194Ce\u0000OH\u0087H\u0087CpHDpH pzc (3) Ce\u0000OH\u2194Ce\u0000O\u0000\u0087H\u0087CpHFpH pzc (4) Si\u0000OH\u0087 2\u0087H2O\u2194Si\u0000OH\u0087H3O\u0087CpKa1\u00880B2 (5) Si\u0000OH\u0087H2O\u2194Si\u0000O\u0000\u0087H3O\u0087CpKa2\u00885B4 (6) According to the theory proposed by Cook L M et al. [15], in the polishing process, cerium compounds react with silicon compounds as follows: Ce\u0000OH\u0087Si\u0000O\u0000\u2194Ce\u0000O\u0000Si\u0087OH\u0000(7) It can be seen that the formation of Ce-O-Si bonds is the main reason for chemisorption. Hingston F J et al.[19] found that the degree of non-specific adsorption of silicic acid and metal oxides is greater. The formation and deprotonation of silicic acid are shown in Formula (8): SiO 2\u00872H2O\u2194Si OH\u00864\u2194SiO OH\u0086\u0000 3\u0087H\u0087(8) Under different pH conditions, different cerium compounds react with silicon compound SiO(OH) 3-, as shown in formula (9) - (11)[20]: \u0000Ce\u0000OH\u0087 2\u0087SiO OH\u0086\u0000 3\u2194\u0000Ce\u0000O\u0000SiO OH\u0086\u0000 2\u0087H3O\u0087CpHDpH pzc (9) Fig. 4.Schematic illustration of CMP process and abrasive grains scratching [14].

According to the existence forms of cerium oxide and silicon oxide at different pH values mentioned above, the Ce-O-Si bond formed by the two is weaker under acidic conditions, but stronger under alkaline conditions due to the absence of excessive acidic ions. Therefore, under alkaline conditions, more cerium oxide particles will be adsorbed on the surface of silicon oxide. In addition, in order to obtain a smoother silicon oxide surface, the cleaning process after CMP is also particularly important. According to the bonding method shown in Fig. 6, the fracture of Ce-O/Si-O bonds can also be used as a breakthrough point for post CMP cleaning. 3.Effect of CeO 2 Abrasive on the performance of dielectric CMP 3.1. Effect of cerium oxide particle size Generally, the preparation methods of cerium oxide include calci- nation [21], sol-gel method [22], precipitation method [23], hydro - thermal method [24], Solvothermal method [25], hydroxide mediated method [26], etc., of which the calcination method is the most commonly used. In the production of cerium oxide, different calcination temperatures will lead to different particle sizes of cerium oxide. Fig. 7 [13] shows the average particle size, Ce3\u0087concentration, and corre - sponding polishing removal rate of silicon dioxide for cerium oxide calcined at different temperatures. It can be seen that the particle size of cerium oxide abrasive increases with the increase of calcination tem- perature, and the fastest increase occurs at 600\u2013800\u2103. At the same time, the material removal rate (MRR) showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, with a boundary point of approximately 1000 \u2103 between the increase and decrease. It is speculated that the increase in MRR is due to the increase of Ce3\u0087concentration caused by the increase in cerium oxide particle size. The reason why the polishing rate did not increase monotonically may be attributed to the decreasing of Ce3\u0087 concentration at too high temperature. The particle size of ceria can affect the MRR and surface roughness in the polishing process, both of which are the key factors in evaluating the polishing performance. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the influence of abrasive particle size on polishing performance. Sampurno Y et al.[27] found through experiments that the coefficient of friction (COF) and MRR of plasma-enhanced tetraethy - lorthosilicate (PETEOS) chips are directly related to the median particle size of cerium oxide abrasives. Generally speaking, the larger the par- ticle size of abrasive, the higher the COF value. Usually, the higher the COF, the larger the corresponding MRR. Because high COF means high shear force, enabling the oxide film to be removed quickly. However, the optimal particle size was not indicated, and the roughness of polished surface was not taken into consideration. In the actual production, it is unrealistic to blindly pursue the polishing rate. The increase in particle size will lead to the increase of surface roughness. Therefore, it is sug- gested to determine the optimal particle size based on the surface state of the wafer. Oh M H et al. [28] synthesized cerium oxide particles with good uniformity using the flux method. The particle size was controlled by changing the calcination conditions, and the main particle sizes were 88, 166, 295 and 417nm, respectively. Using cerium oxide abrasives with different particle sizes to polish silicon oxide and silicon nitride, the MRR shows varying degrees of increase with the increase of abrasive size, so the selection ratio changes. The MRR of silica is about 3989 \u00c5/min, while that of silicon nitride is about 127\u00c5/min using cerium oxide abrasive with a particle size of 295nm. In this case, the maximum selection ratio is 32:1. However, the within-wafer nonuni - formity (WIWNU) increases with the increase of the abrasive particle size. This is because as the abrasive particle size increases, the distri - bution of abrasive particle size in the slurry becomes wider. Different particle sizes of abrasives have different fluidity on the wafer, so a wider particle size distribution will result in different uniformity between the center and edge of the wafer. When the particle size is 295nm, the WIWNU is 14.6%. Considering MRR, removal rate selection ratio and WIWNU, 295nm is a good choice. This provides a reference for the particle size selection of cerium oxide abrasives in practical production. Xu G et al. [14] synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles with control - lable diameter and uniform shape by hydrothermal method. The particle size, corresponding roughness and MRR are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that within a certain particle size range, the surface roughness and MRR are negatively correlated with the abrasive particle size, which is inconsistent with the previous conclusions, and it is speculated that the synthesis method of cerium oxide is different. Although the MRR of silicon oxide polished with cerium oxide synthesized by this method is lower than that using commercial cerium oxide abrasives, the surface roughness of the wafer is 45% lower than that samples polished with commercial cerium oxide, making it more suitable for fused silica polishing. In conclusion, the particle size of cerium oxide abrasive affects the performance parameters of silicon oxide CMP such as MRR, surface roughness, selection ratio, WIWNU and other aspects. In most cases, the Fig. 6.Schematic showing the ceria and oxide interactions at pH 4 and 8 [16]. X. Han et al.",
    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 6particle size of cerium oxide is positively correlated with MRR, that is, the larger the particle size of abrasive, the greater the MRR. However, there are also completely opposite situations, which are related to the synthesis of cerium oxide abrasives. Cerium oxide particles with different sizes can be obtained by controlling the preparation conditions. In the actual CMP process, excessive particle size or strong agglomera - tion can lead to more scratches [29], while too small particle size will cause more Ce residue on the surface of silica. Therefore, when deter - mining the particle size, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the possible defects that may be introduced. 3.2. Effect of Ce3\u0087concentration At present, the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide is generally believed to be that Ce3\u0087plays a major role in the polishing process. Ce3\u0087 forms Ce-O-Si bonds by chemically interacting with silica to form Ce-O- Si bonds. Therefore, the concentration of Ce3\u0087has a significant influence on MRR. In addition, it is also necessary to pay more attention to the influence of Ce3\u0087on the selection ratio and surface roughness. Lee J et al.[30] prepared cerium oxide by hydrogen reduction. Under high temperature isothermal conditions, the reaction time and hydrogen concentration are strictly controlled to prevent the agglomeration of cerium oxide. The hydrogen reduction process and polishing mechanism are shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a) (b), the number of oxygen vacancies increases significantly, resulting in an increase in Ce3\u0087 concentration. Fig. 8(c) shows that the number of Ce3\u0087on the surface of cerium oxide significantly increases after hydrogen reduction, promot - ing the formation of Ce-O-Si bond in the polishing process, thereby improving the polishing efficiency. The Ce3\u0087concentrations obtained by hydrogen at different temper - atures are shown in Table 2, and the data in the table were obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It can be seen that the concentration of Ce3\u0087increases with the increase of reaction temperature. Cerium oxide particles (main particle size: 100nm) treated by hydrogen reduction at different temperatures were used to polish silica, and the results are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen from Fig. 9(a) that MRR increases with the increase of treatment temperature. As can be seen from Table 2, Ce3\u0087concentration is positively correlated with the tem- perature range of 400\u20131000 \u2103. Therefore, within this temperature range, the higher the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the higher the MRR. As can be seen from Fig. 9(b) - (e), the surface roughness does not fluctuate obviously, because the hydrogen reduction does not alter the basic physical properties of cerium oxide. When the temperature of 1000 \u2103, the concentration of Ce3\u0087increased by 12.7% and the MRR increased by 37.7%, compared with that before reduction. However, the polishing performance of ceria after hydrogen reduction at higher temperatures are not mentioned, so it is expected to further improve the polishing rate without reducing the surface quality. It is suspected that the reason why the temperature did not increase further is that cerium oxide can aggregate at too high temperature. Myong K K et al. [31] controlled the concentration of Ce3\u0087on the surface of cerium oxide nanoparticles by ultrasonic treatment with deionized water or 15vol% hydrogen peroxide, in which the average particle size of ceria nanoparticles was 32.6 (\u00b16.1) nm. The Ce3\u0087 concentration before treatment was 16.3%, while after treatment it was 21.1% (H2O2 treatment), 21.5% (ultrasonic treatment) and 25.1% (H2O2 and ultrasonic treatment), respectively. Therefore, the concen - tration of Ce3\u0087can be increased by hydrogen peroxide and ultrasonic treatment. The relationship between Ce3\u0087concentration and the inter- action between ceria and silica was tested using AFM and QCM. It was found that the higher the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the stronger the interaction between them. However, the strong interaction also leads to the cerium particles easily remaining on the wafer surface after CMP, increasing the difficulty of cleaning after CMP. Therefore, the concen - tration of Ce3\u0087should be adjusted appropriately to balance the perfor - mance of CMP and the possible difficulties that may be encountered in cleaning after CMP. Netzband C et al. [32] treated cerium oxide particles (average particle size: 68nm) with a concentration of 1.0wt% using deionized water and different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0.5\u20135wt%). The surface of silica was polished with the treated slurry and commercial cerium oxide abrasive (average particle size: 50nm) to analyze the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration on MRR and surface roughness, as shown in Fig. 10: When hydrogen peroxide concentration was 0.5wt%, both the maximum MRR and the minimum surface roughness were obtained, which is very rare. Although the particle size is larger than that of commercial cerium oxide, the surface roughness after polishing is smaller than that of commercial cerium oxide. Furthermore, the Si3N4 surface was polished with the determined optimal slurry (ceria with a concentration of 1.0wt% and average particle size of 68nm, 0.5wt% hydrogen peroxide, pH 8), and the selection ratio of SiO2 to Si3N4 was 3:1. Although the selectivity is superior to than that of commercial cerium oxide slurry, there is still a large gap compared to 30:1 selection ratio required for the polishing process.

Han et al.",
    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 7It can be concluded that the concentration of Ce3\u0087can be changed through methods such as hydrogen reduction, controlling the calcina - tion temperature, adding hydrogen peroxide additives, and ultrasonic treatment. A higher concentration of Ce3\u0087may not necessarily be better, and the subsequent cleaning process needs to be considered. At the same time, the selection ratio between SiO2 and Si3N4 should be also considered. In addition, the CMP performance of the dielectric can also be optimized through surface modification, which will be discussed in detail in the next section. 3.3. Effect of surface modification of cerium oxide 3.3.1. Doped lanthanide metals - Physical modification Research has shown that doping lanthanide metals with lower oxidation state than Ce4\u0087can reduce the formation energy of oxygen vacancies in cerium oxide nanoparticles [33] and produce more oxygen vacancies. The structure of cerium oxide doped with neodymium(Nd) is shown in Fig. 11[34] . The addition of Nd causes more oxygen atoms to escape, forming oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies can reduce Ce4\u0087in cerium oxide to Ce3\u0087, resulting in a decrease of Ce4\u0087concentration and an increase in Ce3\u0087concentration [35]. However, not all trivalent lanthanide metals can increase the concentration of Ce3\u0087. Lanthanide metals with positive binding energy to oxygen vacancy (Sm, Nd, etc.) can increase the concentration of Ce3\u0087, while lanthanide metals with negative binding energy to oxygen vacancy (Ho, Er, etc.) can reduce the Fig. 8.Schematic illustration of the (a) crystal structure of ceria changed by hydrogen reduction, (b) process of hydrogen reduction in ceria, and (c) the polishing mechanism of SiO2 wafer with original and hydrogen-reduced ceria particles [30].

The physical and chemical properties of ceria can be improved by doping La, Nd, Yd and other less reductive lanthanide elements into ceria nanoparticles. At the same time, adding appropriate dispersants such as polyacrylamide (PPI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyr- rolidone (PVP), and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), can improve the stability of doped cerium oxide. The cerium oxide doped with La/Nd/Yb precipitated after one day. After adding 1vol% PVA, the prepared La/ Nd/Yb doped cerium oxide can remain stable for up to 7 days [37]. Cheng J et al. [38] prepared cerium oxide nanoparticles doped with 5wt % La, 5wt% Nd and 5wt% Yb respectively by impregnation method. The experimental results showed that this doping method could promote Fig. 9.(a) Polishing performance of SiO2 films using original ceria slurry and ceria slurry reduced by hydrogen gas at different temperatures (400 \u20131000 \u2103). 3- dimensional AFM images (5\u00d75\u00b5m2) of the polished wafer surface with (b) original and ceria slurry reduced at (c) 400\u2103, (d) 700\u2103, and (e) 1000 \u2103 [30].

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 9the formation of oxygen vacancy on the surface of cerium oxide particles without affecting the surface morphology of cerium oxide, so as to convert Ce4\u0087into Ce3\u0087and improve the concentration of Ce3\u0087, the TEM test results of the particle surface are shown in Fig. 12. It can be seen from Fig. 12 that the impurity distribution is uniform, and the doped particles are close to spherical shape, with little change compared to before doping. The CMP results show that at pH 5, the dielectric MRR with doped cerium oxide nanoparticles is lower than that without doped cerium oxide at pH 5. At pH 9.5, the MRR of ceria nanoparticles doped with La, Nd and Yb increased by 20.9 wt%, 29.6 wt% and 4.3wt%, respectively, compared to undoped cerium oxide. After polishing with doped cerium oxide nanoparticles, the surface roughness of silicon oxide dielectric is 10\u00c5, which is less than 14\u00c5 using No.2815 commercial cerium oxide. This provides a reference for polishing abrasives under alkaline conditions. However, there is no consensus on the different results at different pH values. It just shows that for undoped ceria, the MRR of silica under acidic conditions is greater than that under alkaline conditions because of the coulombic force. It is speculated that for doped ceria, the reason for the increase in MRR under alkaline conditions is the increase in Ce3\u0087concentration, but the reason for the decrease in MRR under acidic conditions remains to be studied. Kim E et al. [39] synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles by hydro - thermal method and doped with La or Nd with low molar concentration of 20% or high molar concentration of 50%, respectively. The samples were marked as HTC (undoped ceria), NDC-L (ceria doped with 20% Nd), NDC-H (ceria doped with 50% Nd), LDC-L (ceria doped with 20% La), LDC-H (ceria doped with 50% La). It is found that when the pH range is 4.2\u20134.5, the doped cerium oxide can significantly increase the MRR of silica, with a maximum value of 5000 \u00c5/min. The XPS results of HTC, LDC-L, and NDC-L samples are shown in Fig. 13. The Ce3\u0087con- centration was calculated according to the results in Fig. 13, and the values in the three samples of HTC, LDC-L, and NDC-L were 24.54%, 30.40% and 32.57%. Therefore, the reason for the increase in MRR is that the addition of Nd or La increases the concentration of Ce3\u0087. At the same time, the MRR of silicon nitride also improved, but only by a fraction compared to the increase in the MRR of silica. Therefore, the selection ratio of SiO2 and Si3N4 polished with doped cerium oxide is also improved, which provides a way to improve the selectivity of silica to silicon nitride. The surface roughness of silica obtained by high concentration Nd doping is 0.135 nm, which is lower than that of commercial ceria slurry and pure ceria abrasive. Therefore, the silica CMP performance with high MRR, high selectivity and low surface roughness can be obtained using cerium oxide doped with 50% Nd. Ma J et al. [40] studied the effect of doping different concentrations of La in cerium oxide at pH 9 on CMP performance. That is, the x values in Ce1\u0000xLaxO2 were changed to 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. The MRR values were 59.31\u00b19.95, 81.75\u00b113.53, 92.43\u00b116.34 and 101.12\u00b115.37 nm/min, respectively. This is because the addition of La leads to the decrease in the particle size of cerium oxide, and thus increasing the concentration of Ce3\u0087, which promotes the increase in MRR. The surface roughness after polishing is also improved. In conclusion, doping lanthanide metals with positive binding energy to oxygen vacancy can improve MRR and surface quality without changing the surface morphology of cerium oxide basically, and also provide a physical modification approach for improving the selectivity. However, under similar acidic conditions, the opposite results were obtained in the above paper, which may be caused by the difference of doping con- centration. The mechanism of pH changes affecting doping and Ce3\u0087 concentration still needs further study. 3.3.2. Core-shell structure composite abrasives - physical modification Core-shell composite structure abrasives are usually composed of Fig. 10.Controlling the Cerium Oxidation State During Silicon Oxide CMP to Improve Material Removal Rate and Roughness [32].

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 10two or more materials, including core and shell parts. According to the types of materials, they can be divided into inorganic/inorganic, inor- ganic/organic, organic/inorganic and organic/organic materials, with the former as the core material and the latter as the shell material [41]. The stability of nano ceria is a challenge in the field of materials. In the core-shell structures, shell materials can change the reactivity and thermal stability of the core material, so as to improve the stability of the whole material. At the same time, it can also improve the polishing performance of cerium oxide nanoparticles [42]. Chen Y et al. [43] synthesized polystyrene (PS)/cerium oxide abra- sive by chemical precipitation method. The CMP results showed that the MRR and root mean square (RMS) with pure ceria nanoparticles were 208\u00b145nm/min and 0.43\u00b10.03 nm, respectively, while the values obtained using the PS/CeO 2 core-shell composite abrasives were 186 \u00b129nm/min and 0.28\u00b10.04 nm, respectively. Although the MRR obtained with the core-shell structure is smaller than that with pure cerium oxide, it is still larger than most abrasives due to the advantage of cerium oxide abrasives themselves. In addition, the RMS with core-shell structure abrasives is 34.9% lower than that with pure cerium oxide, with fewer scratches, which greatly contributes to the surface quality of the polished wafer. The reason for the reduction of scratches may be that the prepared composite abrasives have good structural stability. Fig. 14 shows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the abra- sives before and after CMP. It can be seen that the abrasive can still maintain the spherical shape after CMP, indicating good structural sta- bility, which is also the main reason for the improvement of the surface quality after CMP. It can be explained that the improvement of CMP performance with the core-shell structure abrasives is the synergistic effect of organic core and inorganic shell materials. In the CMP process, the PS core increases the contact area between the shell abrasive and the wafer, thus reducing roughness and mechanical damage. Chen A et al. [44] first prepared hexagonal mesoporous silica (H-mSiO 2) particles, and then obtained H-mSiO 2-CeO 2 core-shell com- posite structure abrasive through solution synthesis. The MRR of 203nm/min and RMS of 0.17\u00b10.01 nm were obtained using H-mSiO 2-CeO 2 abrasive for dielectric CMP. The polishing efficiency and quality were greatly improved compared to the result obtained with commercial ceria (MRR 87nm/min, RMS 0.44 nm). This may be due to the low particle density of H-mSiO 2-CeO 2 abrasives, resulting in an in- crease in the number of active particles and the dielectric MRR. In addition, the particle size of cerium oxide will decrease during the synthesis process. From the previous description of the influence of cerium oxide particle size on polishing performance, it can be seen that a reduction of particle size will lead to an increase of Ce3\u0087concentration, thus also improving the polishing efficiency.

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 11It can be concluded that polishing performance, including polishing efficiency and surface quality can be improved by core-shell structure. From this perspective, the advantages of other composite materials can make up for the lack of cerium oxide abrasives. 3.3.3. Modifier - Chemical modification The chemical modification of cerium oxide nanoparticles can in- crease the cohesion, improve the dispersion, reduce the surface energy, eliminate the surface charge, and weaken the surface polarity. The usual approach is to add coupling agents or surfactants [45]. Wortman-Otto K M et al. [46] found by the UV\u2013visible spectrum that additives containing carboxylic acid functional groups can inhibit the MRR of the oxide, such as benzoic acid (BA), glutamic acid (Glu), 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA). Additives containing amino acids or hydroxyl functional groups can promote the MRR of oxides, such as dextrose (Dex), PA, glycine (Gly), and hydroquinone (HQ). The inhibi - tion mechanism of additives with carboxylic acid functional groups is that these additives have strong adsorption force on cerium oxide sur- face at pH 4, resulting in reduced contact between cerium oxide and the surface of the wafers, thus reducing MRR. There is only a weak elec- trostatic interaction between additives with amino acid functional groups and cerium oxide nanoparticles. Amino acids with a ratio of 1:1 between carboxylic acid and amine can replace the binding oxygen on the surface of cerium oxide to achieve the purpose of increasing Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087. Dex and HQ can be used as redox reagent to regulate the concentration of Ce3\u0087. However, researches based on chemical modifi - cation is relatively limited compared with physical modification. At present, there are few reports on the surface morphology of the SiO2 wafer CMP with chemically modified cerium oxide. In summary, the development of ceria CMP slurry needs to consider not only MRR, but also the defects introduced to the wafer surface. Uneven particle size distribution can cause an increase in WIWNU. Strong acid/alkaline polishing slurry can cause certain corrosion to the surface of the wafer and also have a certain impact on the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple factors to achieve a relative balance between MRR and surface quality. In order to promote the industrial production of cerium oxide polishing slurry, subsequent research should comprehensively improve the performance of the polishing slurry. A green and environmentally friendly cerium oxide CMP slurry with high MRR, low defects, and industrial production potential will be the future development trend. 4.Removal of cerium oxide particles during post CMP cleaning The minimum feature size of integrated circuits has been reduced to 7nm and below, post-CMP cleaning faces a more serious challenge of obtaining smooth and defect-free surfaces [47]. The most critical factor for reducing the yield of silicon-based semiconductor devices is the ex- istence of defects [48]. Cerium oxide nanoparticles mainly play a role in forming strong Ce-O-Si bonds in dielectric CMP process [49], and are easily absorbed on the wafer surface with other pollutions after CMP, which may lead to scratches and other defects. Therefore, the cleaning of cerium oxide nanoparticles after CMP becomes particularly important. The Ce-O-Si bonds are more easily formed on the surface of small size ceria particles than in large size ceria particles. Therefore, most large size cerium oxide particles can be removed by physical cleaning, but small size particles often need to be removed by chemical cleaning [50]. 4.1. Introduction of additives Kim J et al. [51] added glycerin to deionized water as an additive to study the effects of viscosity and temperature on particle removal during post CMP cleaning process by inductively coupled plasma mass spec- trometry (ICP-MS). It was found that as the glycerin concentration increased, the Ce3\u0087concentration on the cleaned wafer surface decreased gradually. Therefore, the viscosity of the cleaning solution increases with the increase of glycerin concentration, and the corre - sponding resistance to the particles also increases, which facilitates the removal of cerium oxide particles. By comparing the experimental re- sults at 0\u2103 and 20\u2103, it is found that the lower the temperature, the higher the viscosity of the cleaning solution. Glycerol can be used as an effective additive for removing cerium oxide particles. However, the paper lacks the analysis of the surface morphology of the cleaned wafers. The final surface state of wafers plays a decisive role in the performance of semiconductor devices, so it needs to be further studied. Yan M et al. [52] studied the effect of adding Gly, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1.2-bis-(3-aminopropylamino) ethylenediamine (TAD) to the cleaning solution on the removal of residual cerium oxide after polishing. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) after cleaning are shown in Fig. 15. It was found that when 0.15 wt% EDTA was added into the cleaning solution with pH 11, the particle removal efficiency (PRE) reached the highest (99%), and the surface roughness decreased to 0.45 nm. The PRE of the cleaning solution with Gly and TAD added was 96.8% and 93.8%, respectively, and the surface roughness was 0.95 nm and 1.41 nm, respectively. Through the analysis of the mechanism of action, it was found that EDTA broke the Si-O bond through the downward cutting effect of carboxyl functional groups in EDTA, and formed a soluble complex with Ce3\u0087through the complexa - tion reaction. Therefore, glycerin or complexing agents containing carboxyl func- tional groups can be added to the cleaning solution to increase PRE of ceria in the cleaning process and obtain better surface morphology. 4.2. Water cleaning Yun J et al. [53] improved the polishing and cleaning process by first polishing with cerium oxide slurry, and then polishing and cleaning the wafer simultaneously with remaining cerium oxide slurry on pad and deionized water (DIW), referred to as the ceria/DIW combined process. The process steps are shown in Fig. 16. The entire process is set at 60s, Fig. 14.TEM images of the used PS/SiO 2 composite abrasives (a) and PS/CeO 2 composite abrasives (b) after CMP [43]. X. Han et al.",
    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 12and the effectiveness of the process is explored by setting different times for the two-step process. the optimal process time is ceria 40s/DIW 20s. Under this process, the particle area ratio (the ratio of the area of cerium particles to the total area) decreased from 9.035% to 0.839%. The Ce concentration decreased from 1552.55 ppb to 83.25 ppb through ICP-MS testing. The surface roughness is 0.150 nm. Therefore, cleaning efficiency and surface quality have reached a higher level. Liu P et al. [54] prepared N2 water and CO2 water using a gas dis- solved water system. The pH values of DIW, N2 and CO2 water are 6.2, 5.2 and 3.9, respectively. The results showed that PRE of ceria obtained Fig. 15.FE-SEM images (at 10kx magnifications) of SiO2 surfaces after CMP and post-CMP cleaning process. (a) post CMP (b), (c), and (d) after cleaning with 0.1wt % Gly, 0.15 wt% EDTA and 0.15 wt% TAD, respectively (e) quantitative estimation of particle counts on the sample surface obtained by FE-SEM using Image J [52]. X. Han et al.",
    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 13by N2 water and CO2 water cleaning were both greater than that ob- tained by DIW, and the PRE obtained by CO2 water cleaning was the highest. The residual cerium oxide particles on the wafer surface are easy to agglomerate after N2 water and DIW cleaning, but the residual particles obtained after CO2 water cleaning are relatively dispersed. The experiments were conducted by changing the concentration of CO2 in CO2 water, and it was found that PRE of ceria decreased with the decrease of CO2 concentration. The surface roughness is 0.613 \u00b10.025 nm when the particle size is large, while the surface roughness is 0.077\u00b10.010 nm when the particle size is small. The PRE of ceria obtained through CO2 water cleaning is the highest and the surface roughness is the lowest, whether the cerium oxide particles with large or small size are cleaned. The CO2 water cleaning mechanism is (as shown in Fig. 17) mainly relies on CO2 (with negative Zeta potential) adsorp - tion on the surface of cerium oxide particles (with positive Zeta poten - tial) to prevent the aggregation and accumulation of cerium oxide particles on the substrate surface. Lee J et al. [55] used tangential flow filtration (TFF) system to filter out cerium oxide particles with smaller particle size (D50nm) for dielectric CMP, and then cleaned them with DIW. This method increased the PRE of water cleaning by 18.1%, achieving performance similar to SC1 (NH 4OH:H 2O2:H2O\uff0c1:1:5) solution. When using water cleaning, the PRE of ceria can be increased by improving the process time or dissolving gas in water. Adding CO2 to water provides a new way for removing small-sized cerium oxide nanoparticles. Although the TFF system improves the PRE of ceria for water cleaning, it is only suitable for the using large-sized cerium oxide particles for CMP. Water cleaning can achieve larger PRE of ceria without causing secondary pollution, which not only saves costs but also protects the environment. In line with the concept of green and envi- ronmental protection, water cleaning is a big trend in the future. 4.3. Chemical cleaning Chemical cleaning is generally combined with physical cleaning methods. Chemical cleaning plays a major role in the post CMP cleaning process due to the special Ce-O-Si bond between cerium oxide and sili- con dioxide. The most commonly assisted physical cleaning methods are polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) brushing [56,57] and ultrasonic cleaning [58]. Seo J et al. [50] studied the cleaning efficiency (CE) of SC1 cleaning solution with different component proportions under ultrasonic on cerium oxide particles with size of 10, 30 and 90nm. It was found that when H2O2 (30wt%) accounted for 43% and NH4OH (30wt%) accounted for 57%, that is, the molar concentration was basically equal, the CE of the three different particle size abrasives was relatively high, all of which were 99%, exceeding the CE of the standard SC1 solution (19%, 58%, 94%). This is because the molar concentrations of peroxide and hydroxide are essentially equal, and the concentration of HO2- in the solution reaches its maximum value. HO2- removes cerium oxide parti- cles from the wafer surface by breaking the Si-O bond in Ce-O-Si. The removal process is shown in Fig. 18. This method can effectively solve the cleaning problem of small-sized cerium oxide nanoparticles. How- ever, the literature did not mention the analysis of the surface morphology of the cleaned wafers. If the surface roughness is low, this method of high efficiency particle removal can be promoted. Sahir S et al. [59] found that both megasonic cleaning and PVA brush cleaning could only achieve higher PRE for cerium oxide with larger particle size, while chemical cleaning is more effective in removing ceria with small particle size. When SC1 was used to clean wafers for less than 10min, the PRE of ceria exceeded 95% for ceria nanoparticles with particle sizes of 30,60 and 90nm. SC1 cleaning solution mainly gener - ates relatively strong electrostatic repulsion by changing the surface charge of particles and wafers, and has a slight etching effect to achieve a better cleaning effect. Diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF) can be used to remove cerium oxide particles through lower shear mechanism and etching. However, it has a good effect on ceria only with small particle size. For cerium oxide particles with size of 30nm and 60nm, the PRE can reach more than 95% by cleaning the wafer surface with DHF for 60s. But for 90nm particles, PRE is below 80%. SPM (H2SO4:H2O2\uff0c 2:1\u20134:1) is also more suitable for the removal of small-sized cerium oxide particles, mainly because it can promote the dissolution of cerium oxide. For 30nm cerium oxide, the PRE reaches 99%, but for 90nm particles, the PRE is less than 20%. Therefore, in actual production, it is necessary to determine the type of cleaning solution according to the particle size of cerium oxide to be removed. However, due to the strong Fig. 16.Schematic of the ceria remaining on the pad during chemical mechanical planarization [53]. Fig. 17.The mechanism and comparison of DIW and CO2 water buff cleaning.

    "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 679 (2023) 132551 14acidity of the reagent used, the surface morphology of the wafer may be greatly affected. Song J et al.[60] developed a new cleaning solution consisting of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), EDTA and dispersant. The silicon dioxide and silicon nitride films were respec - tively cleaned with the proposed cleaning solution. The particle cleaning efficiency (PCE) of silica surface reached 99.5%, among which ceria cleaning efficiency (CCE)reached 98.3%. The PCE and CCE of silicon nitride surface reached 97.8% and 96.3% respectively. Because the cleaning solution has no etching effect, the surface roughness obtained is better than that obtained by SC1 and SPM. However, the paper did not mention the particle size of cerium oxide. Since most cleaning methods have a certain degree of selectivity for particle size, it is necessary to compare the performance of cleaning solutions towards various particle size. In SC1, SPM and DHF chemical cleaning, a large amount of cleaning solution is used, but they all cause certain etching on the wafer surface. Therefore, for future research directions, on the one hand, further dilution of the cleaning solution or the addition of mild additives should be considered to reduce the etching effect and improve the surface quality; On the other hand, it is necessary to develop a new environ - mentally friendly cleaning solution to meet the removal of small parti- cles. The development trend of future cleaning solutions should also consider green environmental protection and more use of harmless organic compounds for human health. In addition, room temperature cleaning processes are also a focus of research and development. The green cleaning solution with low cost and high CE for removing cerium oxide is the future development direction. 5.Conclusion With the reduction of feature size in integrated circuits, the perfor - mance and surface residue requirements of dielectric layer CMP based on cerium oxide abrasives have become increasingly stringent. This article mainly summarizes the factors that affect the CMP performance of cerium oxide abrasives, including the particle size of cerium oxide abrasives, the value of Ce3\u0087/Ce4\u0087and surface modification. The particle size can be controlled by changing the calcination temperature or preparation method. Generally speaking, particle size is proportional to MRR, but the optimal particle size needs to be determined based on the surface quality of CMP chips. Ce3\u0087enhances chemical interactions dur- ing wafer CMP process by forming Ce-O-Si bonds on the surface of silica, thereby improving MRR. The concentration of Ce3\u0087can be changed by methods such as hydrogen reduction or introducing oxygen vacancies with other additives. Physical and chemical modifications can alter the inherent chemical properties of cerium oxide without altering its surface morphology. This provides a reference for the changes in Ce3\u0087con- centration and the improvement of selection rate. In addition, Ce par- ticles will remain on the surface of the chip after dielectric CMP, which will have a serious impact on the subsequent process of integrated cir- cuit manufacturing and even cause failure. Therefore, this article ana- lyzes the method of cleaning cerium oxide particles after CMP, which improves the cleaning efficiency of cerium oxide by adding additives such as glycerol or complexing agents containing carboxyl functional groups, or by dissolving gas in water. The use of acidic/alkaline chem - ical reagents can effectively remove cerium oxide particles, but it is necessary to consider how to achieve the best cleaning effect with the lowest concentration of reagents for different cerium oxide particle sizes. The improvement of MRR and the reduction of defects usually cannot be achieved simultaneously, so more systematic research is needed to balance the relationship between the two. Furthermore, the development trend of cerium oxide abrasive CMP slurry and post cleaning is prospected, and it will be the optimal choice for cerium oxide abrasive CMP and post cleaning to be environmentally friendly and efficient.

Hong Jin Kim Additional information is available at the end of the chapter Abstract Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of the most essential processes in semi - conductor manufacturing. Its importance becomes highly underscored at the advanced device toward sub 14 nm scaling. The fundamental mechanism of CMP is to create soften surface layer by chemical reaction and then, mechanical force by abrasive particles remove soften layer. The role of CMP is not only material removal, but also planarization, surface smoothening, uniformity control, defect reduction and more. Moreover, semiconductor yield enhancement is sensitively influenced by CMP processing. Surface scratching, which is generated by CMP in nature, is considered as \u2018killer defect\u2019 in semiconductor manufac - turing. Hence, to achieve proper CMP performance without surface scratching, under - standing and development of abrasive particles are crucially important. In this chapter, CMP fundamentals, applications and challenges associated with abrasive particle technol - ogy including synthesis (up to nanoparticle scale), tribochemical reaction, abrasive surface zeta potential behavior, particle size and its distribution will be discussed. Keywords: semiconductor manufacturing, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), slurry, silica abrasive, ceria abrasive, alumina abrasive, advanced abrasive materials 1. Introduction Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has been used for several decades in semiconductor manufacturing since its development at 1980s [ 1\u20135]. The original purpose of CMP is to pla - narize wafer surface both locally and globally, which enable subsequent lithographic pattern - ing with proper depth of focus [ 1\u20135]. However, as device shrinkage continues, it has become critical process for device fabrication, and its applications play a pivotal role in semiconductor process since transistor scaling becomes beyond 14 nm [ 5\u20139]. The role of CMP and planarized wafer associated with lithography patterning is shown in Figure 1 schematically [ 1, 4]. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s). Licensee IntechOpen.

    "Surface topography hinders conformal deposition of photoresist, leading to distorted pat - terning. Furthermore, advantages of employment of CMP in semiconductor manufacturing are [ 4, 5]: (1) elimination of step coverage burden, (2) defect removal from prior process steps, (3) surface smoothening in wafer scale, and (4) enablement of metal gate formation at sub 14 nm device. The fundamental mechanism of CMP process is [ 1\u20134]: (1) Material surface becomes soften by chemical reaction with slurry, (2) Mechanical force by abrasive particle in the slurry removes soften layer and step height reduction, (3) Material surface reacts with slurry chemical to make surface soften layer again and repeat (1) \u2013 (3). Therefore, chemistry and abrasive particles in the slurry determines CMP performances. This procedure is given in Figure 2 . With this process, fast material removal across the wafer with planarization can be achieved. From the abrasive perspective, abrasive-wafer contact model on removal rate has been published in many literatures which emphasize abrasive particle size (and size dis - tribution) and shape, and abrasive hardness. Although CMP application had started from planarization of excessed dielectric materials, its utilization have been widely accepted in shallow trench isolation, contact and metal interconnection formation [ 1\u201310 ]. Recently, sub 14 nm semiconductor scaling has developed device integration scheme to 3-dimensional tran - sistor formation such as fin field-effect transistor, therefore device process flow becomes much more complicated than previous device node [ 6\u20139, 11, 12 ]. Hence, application of CMP extends to transistor formation, and importance of CMP process becomes highly underscored. Figure 3(a) shows polisher equipment and wafer polishing processing. Polishing head holds wafers by vacuum and it rotates on the polishing pad. Slurry is delivered by slurry arm and polishing pad conditioner refreshes polishing pad surface as each wafer processing, which results in global planarization and polishing. Whereas, in microscale observation, compli - cated interaction among pad asperity-slurry (abrasive and chemistry)-wafer surface occurs during CMP processing, which is depicted in Figure 3 . According to semiconductor process development, CMP process itself has developed its equipment, consumables, polishing func - tions and slurries to improve performance. CMP performances are defined by removal rate (throughput), selectivity, planarization (pla - narity), within wafer non-uniformity, surface topography (roughness), corrosion and post CMP defects. The definitions of them are: Figure 1. The concept of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Non-planarized topography becomes planarized surface by CMP.Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 184",
    "Removal Rate (RR) = (pre CMP thickness \u2013post CMP thickness ) / (polishing time ) Within Wafer Uniformity = Film thickness sigma post CMP / Film mean thickness post CMP Selectivity (A : B) = RR of A material / RR of B material Planarization is commonly measured by step height reduction rate. These performances are closely related with device yield and electrical performances. For example, CMP-induced microscratch defect ( Figure 4 ) is detrimental to device yield [ 3, 5]; transistor resistance is strongly influenced by post CMP uniformity, and residual material blocks subsequent pat - terning. CMP performances are determined by multiple CMP process factors; however, CMP slurry is the most influencing parameter. CMP slurry consists of abrasive particles and chemi - cal components such as pH adjuster, dispersant, polymeric additives, oxidizer, and passivation agent, depending on polishing purpose to provide proper surface modification of material. As described in Figure 3 , direct contact between abrasive particle and wafer surface removes material, thus, properties and characteristics of abrasive particle and their understanding are inevitable to optimize CMP process. Although a lot of different kinds of abrasives have been tried for CMP applications, three abrasives have been employed successfully until recent device manufacturing. They are silica-based abrasive, ceria-based abrasive, and alumina-based abra - sive. However, CMP is indispensable process for future semiconductor fabrication and it needs development of new abrasives for the success of new designed device and matured manufac - turing. Figure 5 shows CMP abrasive market trend in semiconductor industry [ 14]. Its growth expectation for the next 4 years is about 30% increase from 2016. This chapter introduces abra - sive particles and their applications to CMP process for semiconductor manufacturing. Figure 2. The schematic mechanism of material removal by CMP. Figure 3.

    "2. Abrasive for dielectric CMP A dielectric material in semiconductor processing refers to insulating materials and mostly it indicates all kinds of silicon oxide materials [ 5]. Most dielectric CMP applications focus on transistor formation, which is called as front end of the line (FEOL) process. And dielectric CMP requires either oxide bulk CMP or CMP stop on \u2018stopper\u2019 material. For the stop on CMP case, oxide material is removed by CMP and CMP stops when stopper material is exposed. Shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP and interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP are representative dielectric CMP applications. STI CMP process (stop on \u2018silicon nitride\u2019) is described in Figure 6 [3] as an example of dielectric CMP. The stopper materials are mostly silicon nitride or poly- silicon in FEOL process. For dielectric CMP purpose, two \u2013 three major abrasives are used in the advanced node semiconductor manufacturing. 2.1. Silica-based slurry and silica abrasive As briefly described in the introduction, CMP mechanism is soft layer removal by abrasive particle. This section introduces silica particle as slurry abrasive. During dielectric CMP pro - cess, silicon oxide surface reacts with OH\u2212 from the slurry solution and forms silicon hydrox - ide, Si(OH)4. The hydration reaction is. Figure 4. The examples of CMP-induced microscratch images [13]. Figure 5. Slurry abrasive market trend (Reprinted from Ref. [ 14] with permission from author. Copyright Linx- consulting).

    "( SiO 2 ) x + 2H 2 O \uf0e0 ( SiO 2 ) x\u22121 + Si (OH) 4 And this soften Si(OH)4 is mechanically removed by silica abrasive [ 3, 15]. Then silicon oxide surface is exposed and hydration occurs again. This process is repeating until silicon oxide disappears. From Figure 2 , soft layer can be considered as Si(OH)4 in this case. The hydration rate is influenced by the concentration of OH\u2212 ions in the solution, thus alkaline environment can accelerate surface hydration and make fast material removal by fast reaction [ 2, 15\u201316]. Therefore high pH silica-abrasive slurry is favorable to obtain high removal rate. Two common synthesizing methods of silica abrasives are commercially used in the semiconductor industry. One is fumed process and the other is colloidal process [ 5, 17\u201319]. The typical abrasive images Figure 6. Procedure of shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP.

    "of silica abrasive by each synthesis methods are shown in Figure 7 [20, 21 ]. Fumed silica syn - thesis uses flame reaction of chlorosilane at high temperature, which is summarized at. SiCl 4 + 2H 2 + O 2 \uf0e0 SiO 2 + 4HCl With this method, early development of silica abrasive particle size is larger than 300 \u00c5, but development of filtration and post treatment enables to control the abrasive size below 150 \u00c5. The commercial fumed silica abrasive slurry for dielectric CMP has high abrasive concentra - tion to achieve enough removal rate. However, high abrasive concentration caused scratch defects, easy to agglomerate and clogging problem in slurry delivery system or filter. Figure 8 shows example of clogged silica abrasive, which leads to significant defects on the wafer at post CMP. The whitish particles are silica abrasive in the slurry loop system. Therefore recent device manufacturing use high percentage of fumed silica abrasive slurry less and less, and forecast expects less usage of fumed silica abrasive as shown in Figure 5 . Contrary to fumed method, colloidal abrasive is synthesized by liquid phase growth process via precursor [5, 16, 18 \u201325]. Commonly, colloidal silica is made from sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) or sodium meta-silicate (NaHSiO3). By ion exchange, sodium ion is eliminated and colloidal silica is formed to be used as CMP slurry abrasive. Colloidal silica abrasive slurry has much lower removal rate than fumed silica abrasive although it gives much lower scratch defect perfor - mance by its spherical shape and small size. To enhance removal rate of dielectric material by colloidal silica, organic cation is added as removal booster [ 16]. It changes colloidal silica abra - sive surface charge from negative into positive and coulombic attraction force between abra - sive and dielectric surface, which is negative, accelerates removal rate. As shown in Figure 9(a) , surface zeta potential behavior with respect to pH [ 26] can support this mechanism. Schematic of enhanced removal rate by colloidal silica abrasive is given in the same Figure. pH control is critical to this case. Recently, several attempts to new synthesis of silica abrasive to add Figure 7. TEM images of (a) fumed (Reprinted by permission from [ 20], Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society) and (b) colloidal silica abrasive [21].Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 188",

    "more stable particle distribution have been reported [ 26\u201329]. For instance, Pan et al. presented silane modified silica abrasive particle preparation to mitigate gelation of colloidal silica due to high chemically active hydroxyl group from silica surface. The siloxane groups in silane and hydroxyl groups in silica surface generate hydrolysis condensation reaction, which results in surface zetapotential change to improve dispersion stability [ 27]. 2.2. Ceria abrasive for dielectric CMP slurry Although high removal rate, low cost of ownership and effective planarization are obtained by silica abrasive, selectivity control and low scratch defect requirements bring ceria-based abrasive to be universally used in dielectric CMP of advanced node semiconductor manu - facturing. And recent dielectric CMP uses ceria-based slurry much more than before (refers to Figure 5 ). The CMP mechanism by ceria-based slurry is different from silica-based slurry. Instead of mechanical removal by silica abrasive, ceria abrasive uses surface interaction with silicon oxide dominantly, which is. \u2212 Ce \u2212 OH + \u2212 SiO \u2212 \uf0e0 \u2212 Si \u2212 O \u2212 Ce + OH \u2212 Strong bonding between Ce and hydrated silicate detach silicon oxide and Si-O-Ce lump is removed from the surface [15, 30]. Ceria CMP process is shown in Figure 10 . Therefore, ceria abrasive surface charge control is important in determining CMP perfor - mance. The surface charge behavior can be indicated by ceria zeta potential property [ 31]. As shown in Figure 11(a) , isoelectric point (IEP) of ceria is ~pH 8 (at acidic: positive charge, at alkaline: negative charge) and surface potential is opposite to silicon oxide at acidic envi - ronment. Thus, most ceria-abrasive slurry pH is less than 8 to facilitate Si-O-Ce formation. Similar to silica abrasive synthesis, two types of ceria-base abrasive are commonly synthe - sized for CMP applications [ 5, 31, 32 ]. They are calcined ceria abrasive and wet (or colloidal) ceria abrasive. Calcined synthesis is based on solid-state oxidation process. Raw ceria mate - rial is oxidized followed by mechanical crushing to make them small particles. And filtra - tion removes large particles. Depending on crushing condition and filtration, calcined ceria abrasive size can be controlled. On the other hand, wet process uses precipitation procedure in liquid state. Seed ceria nuclei in an aqueous cerium solution grows and forms ceria (or cerium hydroxide) particles. Ceria abrasive made by wet process has spherical shape and nar - row particle size distribution compared with calcined process. These synthesis methods and typical ceria abrasive images from each method are shown in Figure 11(b) \u2013(d) schematically Figure 10. The schematic mechanism of oxide removal rate by ceria abrasive.Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 190",
    "[31, 33 \u201335]. The overall property comparison between calcined processed ceria abrasive and colloidal ceria abrasive is summarized in Table 1 [31]. Calcined ceria abrasive slurry pro - vides steady removal rate. Wet ceria abrasive slurry shows relatively lower removal rate than calcined ceria abrasive, however, the most critical advantage of wet ceria abrasive slurry is scratch defect improvement due to small and regular shape of abrasive particle. Recent study by Seo revealed Ce surface oxidation state had significant influence on the CeO2 interaction to silicate and they investigated the effect of concentration of Ce3+ ions on the affinity to silicate ions and wet ceria particle size effect on the adsorption of silicate [ 35, 36 ]. Higher concentra - tion of Ce3+ ions increased adsorption affinity with silicate ions and larger ceria abrasive has Figure 11.

    "higher Ce3+ ions due to higher surface to volume ratio. In addition to calcined and wet process, flux method to synthesize ceria abrasive particle has proposed to overcome limitation of cal - cined or wet process [ 37]. It uses cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as starting material and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2)-DI mixture as solvent. Through precipitation, hydrothermal reaction and centrifuging process, narrow size distribu - tion with desirable characteristics ceria abrasives synthesis are demonstrated [ 37]. Ceria or ceria-based slurry application in CMP is increasing and advanced slurries with ceria abrasive are emerging in the semiconductor industry. Ultrafine (or nano-sized) ceria abrasive and com - posite abrasive will be introduced in Section 5. 3. Abrasive for tungsten CMP Tungsten has been used for metal interconnection and contact formation. Many candidate metals have been developed to replace tungsten; however, tungsten is still standard metal for sub 14 nm contact formation due to its excellent electromigration and diffusion barrier performance [ 3, 38 ]. The CMP mechanism of tungsten was proposed by Kaufmann firstly [ 39]. A pristine tungsten surface is oxidized by oxidizer at acidic condition and it transforms to tungsten oxide (WOx). The formation of oxide depends on solution and chemistry. Tungsten oxide plays a role as passivation layer to protect subsurface tungsten from dissolution or cor - rosion. And tungsten oxide is easy to be removed by mechanical force of abrasive since its hardness is less than pure tungsten. This process is repeated until CMP stops. Therefore, role of chemistry (in particular oxidizer) is important in tungsten CMP. Among many kinds of oxidizer, ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3-) is the most successful one [ 3, 5]. The schematic description of tungsten CMP mechanism is given in Figure 12 . The common and commercially avail - able slurry for tungsten CMP has alumina-base and silica-base abrasives [ 3, 5]. At sub 14 nm logic device fabrication, tungsten CMP is the most important process to enable transistor formation. It requires superior planarity and extremely accurate uniformity control. For this purpose, alumina abrasive showed better planarity and selectivity performance. Hence its utilization for bulk tungsten CMP is commonly adopted in advanced device manufacturing.

    "Alumina abrasive has been synthesized by alum process and calcination [ 18]. For CMP appli - cation, alpha-alumina abrasive is commonly used. Hardness of alumina abrasive is much higher than tungsten and tungsten oxide, therefore it is easy to make scratch defect on the sur - face. Moreover, due to the surface charge difference between alumina and tungsten at acidic region, attractive force retains alumina abrasive on the wafer surface. Recently, composite alumina abrasive with polymeric material has been introduced in the industry due to defect concern at advanced node semiconductor [ 38]. Silica base slurry utilization on tungsten CMP is usually for non-selective CMP purpose (polishing both tungsten and dielectric material) because its selectivity with oxide is not as high as alumina abrasive slurry. Tungsten CMP is driven by chemical effect more than mechanical abrasion, removal rate strongly depends on chemical components (oxidizer, surfactant, and stabilizer) and activation condition (for example, process temperature) [ 39\u201341 ]. Therefore adequate combinations among them are essential to provide desired CMP performances. Although removal rate is linearly increasing with abrasive concentration in the slurry, loading effect (very low removal rate or non-linear removal rate behavior at the early stage of CMP) is more significant in tungsten CMP than dielectric CMP. Yttrium, ceria, zirconium and composite abrasives have been tried and under development for tungsten CMP applications [3]. 4. Abrasive for copper CMP Copper is introduced in semiconductor manufacturing for metal interconnection application mid-1990s and now it is standard metal for back end of the line interconnection [ 2\u20134, 10]. Accordingly, CMP for copper has been highlighted due to its process challenges. Like tung - sten CMP, copper CMP mechanism is based on Kaufman\u2019s model. Chemical reaction from slurry produces oxidized copper and abrasive particle removes oxidized copper. The major components of copper CMP slurry are abrasive, oxidizer, inhibitor, surfactant and chelating agent. The challenges of copper CMP are scratch defects and copper corrosion. Corrosion is Figure 12. The mechanism of tungsten CMP.Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408193",
    "Figure 13. Synthesis of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive (reprinted from Ref. [ 33] with permission from authors).mostly induced by chemical in the slurry and most of scratch defects are driven by abrasive particle. In particular, hardness of copper is lower than most abrasive particles. Therefore, smaller size of abrasive with spherical shape and less abrasive content are favorable to the slurry formulation. The common copper CMP abrasives are alumina and colloidal silica [ 3, 10]. However, at advanced semiconductor manufacturing, colloidal silica abrasive becomes prevalent because it has appreciable polish rate of barrier material (tantalum/tantalum nitride). The copper removal rate and CMP performances are sensitively influenced by chem - istries and components in slurry in conjunction with silica abrasive characteristics. Most of copper CMP slurry researches have focused on chemistry perspective instead of abrasives. 5. Advanced abrasives for future CMP applications One of the most important requirements of CMP process in semiconductor application is scratch defect reduction, which has mentioned in this chapter several times. For abrasive per - spective, smaller size abrasive particle is favorable for scratch defect. Therefore, recent abrasive technology has focused on nano-sized abrasive synthesis with minimized agglomeration. For dielectric CMP, nano-sized cerium hydroxide (or ultrafine cerium hydroxide or nano-ceria) abrasive slurry has been introduced due to its potential scratch defect reduction [ 33\u201334, 42 \u201343]. The synthesis procedure of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive is given in Figure 13 . Transmission electron microscope image of calcined ceria abrasive and nano-sized abrasive is compared in Figure 14 [44]. Single abrasive size becomes as small as 5 nm. Even agglomer - ated abrasive size is less than 20 nm. Tanaka et al., showed removal rate and selectivity control by changing additives [ 33\u201334 ]. However, CMP mechanism of nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive is not clearly understood yet. Han et al. reported polishing pad surface roughness control is critical to maintain removal rate stability with nano-sized cerium hydroxide abra - sive [ 44]. Kim proposed particle coverage model on the wafer as material removal mechanism with nano-sized cerium hydroxide abrasive [ 43]. In order to apply nano-sized cerium hydrox - ide abrasive for dielectric CMP, role of chemistry to enhance removal rate with selectivity control needs to be further explored. Composite abrasive has drawn attention to the semiconductor industry recently. Each abra - sive has its own unique properties. Some of them are very attractive and some of them are not good for desired CMP performances. Tries to combine advantages only from different abrasives have triggered ceria-silica composite abrasive development [ 45\u201348 ]. Researchers have paid attention to ceria-coated silica as next generation CMP slurry abrasive. Zhao et al. Abrasive Technology - Characteristics and Applications 194",
    "uses sol\u2013gel method to synthesize ceria-coated silica abrasive [ 48]. They prepared tetraethy - lorthosilicate and ammonia as raw materials, and composite nanoparticles are synthesized through precipitation procedure. About 150\u2013200 nm spherical ceria-coated silica abrasives are successfully synthesized. Shell ceria size is 10 nm. Peedikakkandy et al. synthesized mono- dispersed ceria coated silica nanoparticles by micro-emulsion method and chemical precipita - tion process [ 46]. About~10 nm crystalline ceria over silica with spherical shape and overall particle size <100 nm abrasive is successfully obtained. Zhang et al. synthesized ceria-coated silica abrasive by precipitation process using ammonium cerium nitrate and urea as precipi - tant with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) as assistant [ 45]. With optimized synthesis conditions, <200 nm ceria-coated silica abrasive is obtained. In their study, X-ray diffraction confirms face centered cubic CeO2 nanoparticle encapsulate core silica. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows uniformly distributed particles with spherical shape. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) directly shows evidence of homogenous nucleation of ceria particles and heterogeneous nucleation of silica particle with uniform, distinctive and crystalline ceria shell. With ceria-coated silica composite abrasive, higher removal rate than pure silica abra - sive and comparable surface roughness is demonstrated on glass substrate CMP. Likewise ceria-coated ceria abrasive, Chen et al. reported composite abrasive containing solid silica core with silica mesoporous shell structure [ 29]. The advantage of mesoporous silica is its significant elastic recovery ability combined with ductile behavior. Chen et al. synthesized solid silica core via conventional St\u00f6ber procedure and shell silica encapsulating the core by means of modified St\u00f6ber process. It uses vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) as silica source and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as structure directing agent. Well defined spherical shape abrasives are successfully achieved and it shows clearly core-shell structure. The thickness of mesoporous silica shell is controlled by VTMS amount during synthesis. With this abrasive, higher removal rate of thermal silicon dioxide film and lower surface roughness are exhibited. Polymeric composite has drawn attention to CMP society due to its potential scratch defect reduction. Chen et al. reported polymer based core-shell abrasive aiming to reduce scratch Figure 14.

    "defect by CMP. The core abrasive is spherical polystyrene (PS) and ceria is selected as shell abrasive [ 49]. The mechanism of low scratch and minimize wafer damage is cushion effect of soft polymer core abrasive. In-situ chemical precipitation with mixture of deionized water, PS spheres, cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O), and hexamethyleneteramine is used for this hybrid abrasive synthesis. As shown in Figure 15 , it is clearly observed uniformly dis - tributed ceria particles on the PS core, indicating the formation of core/shell structured abra - sive particle. The ceria particle size is about 10 nm and face centered cubic structure which is confirmed by XRD and SAED pattern. Based on CMP test with thermal oxide film, PS/ceria hybrid abrasive slurry demonstrates lower removal rate, fewer scratches, and lower surface roughness are compared with ceria abrasive slurry. Nano-sized ceria abrasive is already used in the semiconductor manufacturing. Ceria-silica or silica-silica composite abrasive is still under development stage although several unique synthesizes are suggested and demonstrate promising CMP data. Most of literatures with composite abrasive focus on material removal rate and surface quality. However, CMP appli - cation needs more performances. In order to be utilized in the industry, composite abrasives have to avoid agglomeration, need to robust abrasive stability, require optimized chemistry, and more CMP performances such as selectivity and defectivity must be fulfilled. New materials CMP has emerged along with new device introduction and device node shrinkage, from ultra-soft materials such as porous low-k and photoresist to highly non- reactive metal such as ruthenium (Ru) [ 3\u20135, 50, 51 ]. Ultra-soft material CMP needs very soft abrasive or even abrasive-free slurry development [ 5]. Ru is little chemical reactive metal with high hardness. And it relies more on mechanical force to remove Ru layer than chemical dissolution. Moreover, RuO4, which can be produced by slurry chemistry, is toxical gas [ 50, 51]. Therefore Ru CMP has a lot of limitation to achieve enough removal rate by CMP. Cobalt (Co) is the most potential candidate metal for replacing tungsten as contact metal (or replac - ing Ta/TaN as barrier metal) and its CMP slurry abrasive development is upmost challenge for device fabrication [ 52\u201354 ]. Known issues by Co CMP are residual abrasive particle defects and Co corrosion. More difficulties on these materials are not only target material CMP but Figure 15.

    "also neighboring materials CMP for proper selectivity. Most of new materials CMP slurry is based on silica abrasive and chemistry optimization has been underscored. However, it still has a lot of opportunities to develop abrasives as well. Carbon based materials (either carbon nanotube or graphene) have drawn intense interests to the semiconductor industry for a long time. For CMP perspective, carbon-based material polishing, which has been rarely reported, is big challenge to abrasive development due to its high hardness. 6. Abrasive control in semiconductor fab The role of abrasive in CMP application is to obtain enough material removal rate, desired selectivity and low defect (residual particle and scratch) performance. In addition to develop advanced abrasive material and synthesis, abrasive size distribution and dispersive ability in the solution has been developed to control large particle count. Particle size distribution is raw abrasive material nature resulting from synthesis, however, slurry distribution system and filtration can control large particles and agglomeration from the slurry without CMP per - formance degradation. In high volume semiconductor manufacturing fab, slurry distribution system is considered as infrastructure instead of equipment [ 18, 55 ]. It consists of (1) slurry drum, (2) agitation of drum (drum tumbling), (3) slurry blending and dispense, (4) daytank (or standby tank) with stirrer, (5) looping to tools. Figure 16 shows simplified distribution system. Slurry is being circulated in the loop until it is used for CMP. Abrasive agglomeration is induced by shear stress, temperature change and chemistry variation if proper filtration is not implemented [ 56]. The location of filters from slurry distribution system is selected care - fully. More filtration drops slurry flow pressure quickly by filter itself. Very fine filter will removes most abrasives, which results in low removal rate. Different slurry needs different type of filter and filtration at different locations; however global loop filtration and point of use (POU) filtration at polishing equipment are quite standard [ 18, 56, 57 ]. Global filter size is normally >10 \u03bcm, which is bigger than POU filter to avoid flow pressure drop. POU filter size is smaller than 1 \u03bcm. Yi Wei et al., showed agglomeration behavior of different slurries. Figure 16. Slurry delivery facilities in semiconductor manufacturing fab. (SD = slurry dispense, SBD = standby distribution).Abrasive for Chemical Mechanical Polishing http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.75408197",
    "Colloidal silica abrasive agglomeration is more sensitive to shear stress than ceria abrasive. The most important challenge of filtration is plugging by abrasives. Three plugging mecha - nisms in filtration are well known, which are cake formation, gradual plugging, and complete plugging [ 58]. Cake formation is driven by particles build up on the filter surface, gradual plugging is induced by particles building up on the pore, and compete plugging indicates pore blocking by particles. Depending on particle size, deformability, and agglomeration, filtration procedure can be optimized. The most commonly used filter in CMP slurry is \u2018graded density depth\u2019 type. It has multi-layers of fibrous media and there is retention gradient along with flow direction. Commonly, large particles are captured first at outer layer and small particles are retained at inner layer. However, more advanced filter and filtration researches are reported recently. Nano-fiber based advanced filter to remove large abrasive as well as avoid agglom - eration is reported. Morby et al., suggested composite/rigid structured filter which consists of thermally bonded polyolefin bi-component coarse fiber matrix and microfiber-glass web as next generation filter to retain slurry flow pressure and remove large abrasive effectively [ 59]. In addition to filtration, dispersant in the slurry prevents abrasive from agglomeration. For high abrasive content slurry case, abrasive particles are easy to sediment and agglomerate by particle charge interaction. Along with slurry abrasive development, advanced filter develop - ment and prevention of sediment of abrasive are required in slurry preparation. 7. Conclusion This chapter reviews abrasives for CMP applications in semiconductor manufacturing. It includes abrasive types, abrasive synthesis, CMP mechanism and role of abrasives, and oppor - tunities of new abrasive developments. Semiconductor business increases explosively and various semiconductor structures with high performance have been developed according to market requirement. In order to achieve mature semiconductor manufacturing, CMP process development is critical and abrasives in slurry play a pivotal role in determining CMP perfor - mances. The most common abrasive in dielectric CMP is either silica-based or ceria-based one. For metal CMP (tungsten and copper), silica is the most popular abrasive. Advanced synthesis for silica or ceria abrasives, new abrasive materials, and composite abrasives have studied for high performance CMP and new material CMP. Furthermore, the control of slurry abrasive in the looping is emphasized. Advanced filtration is critical to maintain abrasive size distribu - tion. The applications of CMP are mostly focused on semiconductor industry; however its utilization expands to display industry, M/NEMs, automobile industry and biotechnology. The key of each application is noble abrasive development with proper chemistries.

He received his Bachelor of Science degree in materials science and engineering from Hanyang University (HYU), Seoul, Korea in 2010, and his Ph.D. degree in energy engineering from HYU in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Ungyu Paik. He was a post-doctoral research associate at the Center for Advanced Materials Processing at Clarkson University from October 2017 to February 2018, where he was mentored by Prof. S.V. Babu. Dr. Seo has worked on many research projects in various fields ranging from fundamental principles (e.g., surface chemistry, colloidal chemistry, nanotechnology, and electrochem- istry) to practical applications [e.g., Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and post-CMP cleaning]. In particular, throughout his career, his research interests have focused on the development of CMP slurries and post-CMP cleaning solutions through a fundamental understanding of colloid and surface chemistry, liq- uid\u2013solid interface chemistry, and the electrochemistry of various metallic and dielectric thin films and het- erogeneous structures containing them. The main objective of his research is not only to understand the various phenomena occurring at the wafer interface during polishing and cleaning but also to provide researchers who study CMP and post-CMP cleaning processes with new strategies and novel concepts for the development of advanced processes for future devices. Introduction Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is one of the most critical processes to achieve multilevel metallization and incor- poration of gate and channel materials during integrated circuit (IC) fabrication [1, 2]. Applications of CMP can be found in three main areas of IC manufacturing that include forming the transistors (front-end-of-line, FEOL), the local electricalconnections between transistors (middle-of-line, MOL), and the interconnect structures (back-end-of-line, BEOL) [1, 2]. The FEOL process contains all the necessary steps to build the device architecture with a variety of CMP steps for different layer combinations of SiO 2,S i3N4, and poly-Si stop layers, SiC, SiCN, etc. and the high-k/metal gate structures [3, 4]. The MOL processes are introduced to connect the individualReview \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021.

    "transistors. W and Co have attracted significant attention as an electrically conducting material for local interconnects for the MOL process steps [5]. In the BEOL process steps, all the num- ber of devices are interconnected by sequentially constructing multilevel Cu wires and insulating layers [6]. CMP has been an enabling technology in the FEOL, the MOL, and the BEOL processes by achieving the desired removal rates, selec- tivity, and ultimately planarity with different substrate materi- als. Each CMP process requires different removal rates, selectivities, and process conditions. As feature sizes continue to decrease, requiring the fabrication of more complex geome- tries, tunable and selective polishing of different films has become even more critical. New CMP steps, including new materials and complex structures, are proposed and present even more stringent requirements. The CMP process has become increasingly sophisticated over the years. Many of the underlying fundamental mecha- nisms are still not well understood. Indeed, CMP technology is advancing faster than our understanding of it. The evolution of high-volume-production CMP processes has its market- driven schedules that are ahead of our understanding of the fundamental principles/technologies. Thus, the demand for understanding of various phenomena that occur during CMP is increasing in both industrial and academic research. CMP utilizes a synergistic interplay of chemical and mechanical interactions to achieve the desired removal rates, selectivity, and ultimately planarity with different substrate materials. During this process, the substrate is pressed down typically onto a grooved polymeric, most commonlypolyurethane pad with controlled hardness and texture under an applied force (Fig. 1). The polishing slurry is transported into the grooves, pores, and texture of the polyurethane pad by rotating the pad at high speed, which generates the chemical and mechanical actions involving three-body (slurry/polishing pad/wafer) interactions (Fig. 1). Many factors including CMP consumables and their process/tool conditions can impact the polishing performance. In this review, I have focused mainly on CMP slurries and their relation to chemical and mechanical aspects of the CMP process. In general, the slurries for the dielectric CMP process are composed of abrasives, dis- persant, passivation agent for high selectivity, pH adjuster, and deionized water. In contrast with dielectric materials, metal CMP is governed by the electrochemical behavior of metal films in the presence of oxidizer, complexing agents, and cor- rosion inhibitors. Metal CMP slurries may contain additional chemical reagents like oxidizer, complexing agent, and corro- sion inhibitor. Typical slurry components for dielectric and metal CMP processes are summarized in Table 1. Slurry for- mulations not only are different depending on the materials to be polished but also need to be optimized to meet the strin- gent process requirements [7, 8]. Their characteristics dominate the various interactions that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface. This review presents and discusses the most significant advances with respect to chemical and mechanical phenomena at the wafer interface during CMP.

Also, the final section provides an overview of recently developed real-time in situ techniques to study some of the phenomena that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013 wafer interface during polishing. Models Based on Contact Mechanics Material removal occurs when there is direct contact between an abrasive particle and wafer surface during polishing. Models based on contact mechanics were proposed to explain the mechanical aspects of the material removal mechanism. Assuming that all particles are involved in material removal, their contact area on the particle \u2013wafer surface is given as A\u221dC1/3\u22c5d\u22121/3where Cis the concentration of the abrasive particles and dis the abrasive diameter [9]. However, only abrasive particles larger than the gap between the polishing pad and the wafer surface, termed as \u201cactive \u201dparticles, can con- tribute to material removal (Fig. 1) [10]. Of course, a larger gap will result in less interaction between particles and wafer. Luo and Dornfeld assumed that only the plastic, but not elastic, deformation caused by the indentation of the active particles into the wafer surface results in material removal. They devel- oped a mathematical model to predict the material removal rates considering the characteristics of the active abrasive par- ticles (size, size distribution, and concentration), pad hardness, and CMP process conditions [10, 11]. The real contact area (Ar) at the wafer \u2013particle interface considering pad asperities with a Greenwood \u2013Williamson approach was proposed by Lee et al. [12], which can be expressed as Ar=(fs/C) (Rp/\u03c3p)1/2(PAw/Epw) where Rpis the average radius of curva- ture of pad asperity, \u03c3pis the standard deviation of the pad asperity height, Pis the applied pressure, Awis the nominal area of the wafer surface, Epwis the compose Young \u2019s modulusof the pad and the wafer, fsis the area density of up area of the grooved pad, and Cis a constant in the range of 0.3 \u20130.4. Lee et al. reported that the real contact area ratio (real contact area/- nominal contact area) continued to decrease over the CMP process, leading to the deterioration in the material removal rates [13]. Park and Jeong suggested that a uniform roughness pad provided much higher removal rates due to the larger real contact area compared with a random roughness pad [14]. While it is very difficult to observe the in situ movements of active particles during polishing, the contact area of pad \u2013 wafer can be measured and has been considered as the real con- tact area in most cases. Borucki has developed a tool to measure the real contact area of pad \u2013wafer using the confocal microscopy and analyzed the contact image with digital image processing [15]. Philipossian et al. investigated the real contact area of a pad with a wafer as a function of the process/tool conditions, pad conditioner, polishing pad, and their combinations [16, 17]. They observed that a higher contact area of pad \u2013wafer results in a higher material removal rate. Later, Lee measured the real contact area of the polishing pad using a home-built tool as a function of applied pressure and abrasive size and pro- posed a modified semi-empirical model to predict the removal rates of SiO 2films [18]. However, according to the classical contact mechanics, when the real contact area between pad and wafer increases, the real contact pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in the material removal rate. The opposite conclusion may be drawn from the properties of CMP consumables (slurry, films, polishing pad, conditioner, etc.), their characteristics, and CMP process condi- tions. More elaborate studies are needed to understand two opposing tendencies of material removal rates. The classic equation for contact mechanics is Preston \u2019s equation [19] expressed as MRR = KPV where MRR is the material removal rate, Kis Preston \u2019s coefficient, Pis the applied pressure on the wafer surface, and Vis the relative velocity between the wafer and the polishing pad. Preston \u2019s equation was very useful in explaining most of the removal rates of dielectric materials in the early stages of CMP technology. However, it assumes a linear relationship between pressure P and relative velocity Vand hence, is unable to explain non- linear polishing behavior in actual CMP [20, 21]. Also, Preston \u2019s equation does not consider the properties of CMP consumables and their characteristics. As the CMP process becomes more and more complex, it has been difficult to pre- dict CMP results and explain their mechanism by only Preston \u2019s equation. Today \u2019s contact mechanics for the CMP process not only consider the properties of CMP consumables and their characteristics but also simulate the fluid dynamics and process parameters, which provide more reliable informa- tion on the actual CMP mechanism [20].TABLE 1.

    "Despite a number of such investigations, more fundamental studies are needed to investigate the in situ measurement of the real contact area of active particles at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface during polishing, especially while considering SiO 2 and CeO 2abrasive particles that have been typically used for CMP applications. Most previous models considered particle size and size distribution, where the particle shape was assumed to be spherical. Their type, hardness, shape, particle agglomer- ation, and chemical reactions between slurry and wafer surface have a significant influence on the material removal rates. These factors have to be taken into consideration in the math- ematical model based solely on contact mechanics. Lubrication Models During polishing, CMP slurries are transported to grooved trenches, pores, and texture of a pad and improve hydrody- namic lubrication (Fig. 1). Sundararajan et al. proposed a lubri- cation model for slurry flow and a mass transport model for material removal by solving the Reynolds equation [22]. According to their numerical results, a 40 \u201360\u03bcm slurry film between the wafer and the pad is expected at an applied pres- sure of 14 kPa and a linear velocity of 1.3 m/s. Slurry film thickness decreased to the range of 15 \u201330\u03bcm with higher applied pressure on the wafer. Lu et al. developed a dual emis- sion ultraviolet (UV)-enhanced fluorescence technique using a dual-camera imaging system to measure the thickness of the slurry film between the pad and a BK-7 wafer and in situ mon- itored the average slurry film thickness during polishing [23]. Philipossian \u2019s group modified this tool with high spatial resolution images, high-intensity UV laser pulses, and enhanced fluorescence [Fig. 2(a)] [24]. They used two different fluorescent dyes that can be excited at different wavelengths and recorded the fluorescence intensities of the dye molecules in the slurry using two high-resolution cameras. The intensity ratio of light detected by each camera was converted to slurry film thickness after proper calibration [Fig. 2(a)] [23, 24]. They also studied the dependence of the slurry film thickness on the type of conditioner disk (design, kinematics, and pres- sure) [26] and pad properties (asperities, roughness, and groove) [25]. They measured the in situ coefficient of friction (COF) along with slurry film thickness. COF showed an inverse relationship with the average slurry film thickness. In thick and more viscous slurry films, the abrasive particles and the pad are less likely to interact with the wafer, resulting in a lower COF. The high viscosity of CMP slurries not only results in ineffec- tive mass transport of reactants across the wafer and poor lubri- cation between the wafer and the pad but also restricts the movement of abrasive particles in the slurry. The relationship between COF and the slurry film thickness is well explained by the Stribeck curve [Fig. 2(b)] [27, 28].By plotting COF against the Hersey number [29], three distinct regions \u2014boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication, and hydro- dynamic lubrication \u2014were identified. The Hersey number is given by \u03b7V/Pwhere \u03b7is the slurry viscosity, Vis the relative velocity between pad and wafer, and Pis the pressure. Region I of this curve, known as boundary lubrication, shows relatively very high COF due to the direct contact between two solid sur- faces. Region II is referred to as mixed lubrication where the wafer does not directly contact a pad because of the slurry film formed between the wafer and the pad. In Region III (hydrodynamic lubrication), the pad and the wafer are fully separated due to the relatively thick slurry film, resulting in a relatively low removal rate and COF. Mullany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically inves- tigated the effect of slurry film thickness on COF during Si wafer polishing in the mixed lubrication region [30], showing that the removal rates of the Si wafer decrease with increasing Hersey number. However, the traditional Stribeck curve fails to explain the lubrication phenomena, while COF and downforce fluctuated significantly during polishing because of the so-called stick-slip phenomena [31, 32]. Han et al. developed a Stribeck+ curve involving instantaneous process valuables [31, 32] (measured shear force and downforce, calculated, and recorded COF), instead of using a constant of shear force and downforce throughout the polishing process, and successfully explained the Stribeck+ curves for SiO 2[31], Cu [32], and W CMP [32] using various combinations of CMP slurries and pads. As mentioned earlier, viscosity is one of the key parameters that control the slurry film thickness and COF [27, 28]. The Hersey number includes viscosity [29], and it was considered as a constant during polishing because most CMP slurries behave as Newtonian fluids displaying a viscosity that is inde- pendent of shear rate. However, Lortz et al. found that the vis- cosity of silica slurries was constant, like Newtonian fluids, only up to a shear rate of 10,000 s\u22121and increased significantly for higher shear rates in the range of 200,000 \u2013300,000 s\u22121[33]. Later, Crawford et al. developed a new methodology to in situ measure the rheological behavior of CMP slurries ( in situ rheo-polishing setup) while polishing the wafer [34]. They observed a fivefold increase in the viscosity of the silica slurries in the presence of 0.15 M KCl with increasing shear rate (\u226510,000 s\u22121). Silica particles can easily form a network structure and agglomerate in an aqueous medium under high shear rates due to their strong hydrogen bonding, triggering a shear-thickening effect [35, 36, 37]. Moreover, in some cases, the heat generated by the chemical and mechanical inter- actions at the wafer \u2013pad\u2013particle interface can have a signifi- cant influence on the slurry viscosity [38]. It usually decreases with increasing temperature. These changes in slurry viscosity should be reflected in the Stribeck curve.Review Journal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 238",
    "Chemical Reactions Between Slurries and Dielectric Films The mechanical effect alone is not sufficient to explain the material removal. Thus, it is essential to understand the chem- ical reactions of slurry components with the wafer surface dur- ing polishing. Since a glass-polishing model was first developed in the 1980s by Brown et al. [39], various theories and concepts have been proposed to explain the removal of materials during polishing. Cook [40] investigated the removal rates of glassusing the slurries composed of various abrasive particles (e.g., alumina, silica, ceria, zirconia, and titania) and found that the ceria particles can interact with the glass surface by forming the strong chemical bonds, which he called as \u201cchemical-tooth \u201d [Fig. 3(a)] [41]. In the aqueous medium, the glass surface reacts with water molecules and forms dissolved silanol (Si(OH) 4)a s expressed by (SiO 2)x+2 H 2O\u2194 (SiO 2)x-1+ Si(OH) 4[42]. According to his model, OH groups on the ceria surface form strong Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds with silanol groups ( \u2013Si\u2013OH/\u2013 Si\u2013O\u2212) on the glass surface during polishing [Fig. 3(a)].

    "proposed chemical reaction is given by \u2013Ce\u2013OH + \u2013Si\u2013O\u2212\u2194\u2013 Ce\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013+O H\u2212[42]. The Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds are much stronger than Si \u2013O\u2013Si bonds, which can be removed by both chemical reaction and mechanical abrasion during polishing. Later, Hoshino et al. [43] suggested that SiO 2surfaces are removed as the form of lumps of Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds based on Fourier trans- form infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis of the post-CMP slurries [Fig. 3(a)]. Babu \u2019s group studied the effects of the Ce oxidation state (Ce3+/Ce4+) on the ceria surface on the interactions with SiO 2film using UV/visible spectroscopy and proposed that the surface Ce3+sites stabilized by an oxygen vacancy are responsible for the high reactivity with SiO 2film [Fig. 3(a)] [44, 45]. They also showed that the reactivity of ceria particles can be lowered by the blocking of the active Ce3+surface sites using various additives [45, 46]. Based on adsorption isotherms of silicate ions, Seo et al. reported thatceria particles with higher surface Ce3+concentrations have higher adsorption affinity with SiO 2films. Taking advantage of these reports, current research for achieving high SiO 2 removal rates is aimed at preparing Ce3+rich ceria particles through either impurity metal-doping or coating. It is well known that lanthanide (La, Sm, Gd, Nd, and Yb) doping can increase Ce3+concentration at the ceria surface, thus enhancing the SiO 2removal rates [47, 48]. Recently, Kim et al. have devel- oped the core/shell type Ce3+rich ceria abrasive for improved SiO 2removal rates [49]. Additionally, by coating the abrasives with a layer of different materials and chemical compositions, it is possible to change the physicochemical properties of the core abrasives and their reactivity with films [49]. Si3N4films can be easily oxidized to SiO 2at the surface when exposed to water or air, and then removed, as in the case of SiO 2films, by chemical reaction (the formation of Ce\u2013O\u2013Si bonds) as well as mechanical abrasion [50].

    "Figure 3(b) shows the overall hydrolysis of Si 3N4film in an aqueous medium; an amine is liberated from Si 3N4film through nucleophilic attack of water molecules, with the overall reaction described as Si 3N4+6 H 2O\u21923SiO 2+ 4NH 3(\u0394G\u00b0= \u2212147 kcal/mol at 298 K) [51]. The oxidized surface layer may be further hydrated as silicate species, which is written as \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261+H 2O\u2192Si(OH) 4. Laarz et al. [41] and Iler [52] showed that the rate of hydration is strongly affected by slurry pH, surface area, the preparation method of film, temperature, etc. Also, Laarz et al. found that the oxidized surface layer on Si3N4film behaved like amorphous silica and determined the activation energy (52 kJ/mol) for the hydrolysis of the amor- phous surface layer [41]. The conversion process/reaction of Si3N4film is important in determining the removal mechanism of Si 3N4,and its removal rate [50]. Babu and co-workers inves- tigated various amino acids (alpha, cyclic, and aliphatic) that can be preferentially adsorbed onto Si 3N4film, inhibiting its hydrolysis to SiO 2[53, 54]. The details of the mechanism of Si3N4removal rate suppression will be discussed in detail. Later, Alety et al. showed that the removal rate of Si 3N4film in the presence of 0.1 wt% ceria particles + 2.3 mM Ce(NO 3)3 at pH 4 was \u223c300 nm/min, whereas it is \u223c10 nm/min with only ceria particle [55]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the polished Si 3N4films is similar to that of an as-received sil- icon oxynitride film which led them to suggest that, in the pres- ence of Ce3+, the surface of Si 3N4film can be converted to silicon oxynitride which was then polished at a high rate [55]. Chemical Reactions Between Slurries and Metal Films Unlike the removal mechanisms of SiO 2and Si 3N4films, metal films (W, Cu, Ru, Ta, and some of their alloys) are very difficult to be polished by only abrasive particles due to their inertness and hardness [1]. Kaufman et al. first proposed the polishing mechanism of W films when the slurry was composed of fer- ricyanide, hydrogen phosphate, and ethylenediamine [56]. A \u201csoft\u201dpassivating layer forms on the W film in the presence of ferricyanide ,[Fe(CN) 6]3\u2212,as an oxidizer, which can be writ- ten as W + 6[Fe(CN) 6]3\u2212+4 H 2O\u2192WO 42\u2212+ 6[Fe(CN) 6]4\u2212+ 8H+[56]. They proposed that the \u201csoft\u201dpassivation layer can be easily removed by mechanical abrasion, and the fresh metal is exposed to the oxidizer again, which is subsequently passivated and then removed [56]. Paul and co-workers pro- posed chemical kinetics of W [57] and Cu films [58] as a func- tion of oxidizer, chelating agent, inhibitor, and mechanical contribution with a mechanical abrasion process. The passiv- ation layer MC* forms on the metal film M in the presence of chemical component C by the chemical reaction; M + C\u2194MC*. The passivation layer can be partially dissolved in the slurries (M bulk+ MC*\u2192MC aq+ M) or removed bymechanical abrasion (MC* + A \u2192MC\u2013A + M) where MC aqis the dissolved species of MC, A is the abrasive particle, and MC\u2013A is the leaving material from the metal surface. Kinetics of competitive reactions of film formation rf=kfNM[C] by oxidizer, film dissolution rd=kdNMC* by chelating agent, and mechanical abrasion rM=kM(Na/A)NMC* by particles determine the removal rates of the metal film where kf,kd, andkMare the rate constants for the reactions, NMandNMC* are the number of M and MC* sites on the metal M surface, [C] is the concentration of the chemical component C in the slurry and Nais the number of the active abrasive particles per unit area Aof the metal surface. Later, Paul and Vacassy extended their model to the systems with inhibitor by combin- ing the reaction and kinetics described above [59]. The mech- anism of this process is used to explain other metal CMP processes, and the possible chemical reactions at the metal sur- face are summarized below [60, 61]. Metal+Oxidizer /shortrightarrowMetal oxide +partially dissolved Metal /Metal oxide +Chelating agent /shortrightarrowFormation of the insoluble passivating layer or Dissolved complex ion Metal+Inhibitor /shortrightarrowFormationof theinsolublepassivatinglayer Metal+H+/OH\u2212/shortrightarrowDissolvedasMn+ Various oxidizers such as H 2O2, KIO 3, Fe(NO 3)3,K2S2O8, and their mixtures have been investigated [56, 62, 63, 64]. H2O2has been widely used as an oxidizer for many metal CMP slurries due to its low cost and powerful oxidizing capa- bility [65, 66]. When both ferric ions and H 2O2are present, fer- ric ions can lead to the decomposition of H 2O2into the free hydroxyl radicals ( \u22c5OH), powerful oxidants, through the Fenton reaction. These radicals can rapidly form a \u201csoft\u201dpas- sivation layer on the metal film, resulting in high MRR and improved topography of metal film [62, 67]. Chelating agents such as glycine and citric acid that form a complex with metal ions can also help in the material removal by forming either insoluble or soluble surface complexes on the metal sur- face [68, 69]. However, corrosion defects such as pitting, crack- ing, and excessive etching will inevitably occur when the metal films are exposed to corrosive reagents [70]. Organic inhibitors containing heteroatoms such as O, N, and S have been used to inhibit the corrosion of a metal. They can be effectively chem- isorbed on the metal surface through the lone pair of electrons on these heteroatoms. Azole derivatives such as benzotriazole (BTAH, often referred to simply as BTA) and 1,2,4-triazole (TAZ) have been used as a corrosion inhibitor for the metal film during polishing, as discussed later in the section on the inhibitor.Review Journal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 241",
    "The mechanism of the metal CMP process involving the continuous cycles of the formation of a passivating layer on the metal film by oxidizer and inhibitor, removal of the passiv- ating layer by the mechanical action, dissolution by chemical reactions, and re-passivation of the metal film is shown in Fig. 3(c). Electrochemical Reactions Metal CMP is governed by electrochemical behaviors of metal films in the presence of oxidizer, complexing agents, and cor- rosion inhibitors. When exposed to slurry components, the metal film is oxidized and loses electron, forming metal cation (anodic reaction, M = M++e\u2212) and the corresponding cathodic reduction reaction receives electrons (O 2+4 H++4 e\u2212=2 H 2O). Oxidation/dissolution and passivation of metal films occur at the open circuit potential (OCP) of each system [71]. The OCP transients stabilize when the anodic and cathodic sites arrive at a saturation point, and the OCPs and pH values of the slurries are used to predict the thermodynamically stable chemical compounds or species of a given metal film in the slurry components according to Pourbaix diagrams (or E-pH diagrams). The general E-pH-dependent reaction at 25 \u00b0C can be expressed as a(Ox) + mH++ne\u2212\u2194b(Rd) + cH2O where a,m,b, and care the number of molecules, nis the num- ber of electrons involved in the reaction, and Ox and Rd denote the oxidized and reduced species of the active redox couple, respectively. E-pH diagrams were constructed by using the Nernst equation and appropriate equilibrium constantexpressions [72]: E=E0\u2013(2.303 RTm )/(nF)pH +(2.303 RT/nF) log(COxa/CRdb)w h e r e Eis the actual cell potential at nonstan- dard condition, E0is the standard reduction potential, Ris the gas constant, Tis the absolute temperature, Fis the Faraday constant, and COxand CRdrepresent the concentration of the species Ox and Rd involved in the E-pH-dependent reactions. Pourbaix diagrams for various metal \u2013slurry systems for CMP applications have been developed [73]. A goal of metal CMP is to uniformly polish the intercon- nection materials (Cu, Co, Al, W, etc.) and the barrier materials (Ta, TaN, Ti, TiN, Co, Ru, etc.) with the desired removal rates and selectivity while minimizing CMP-related defects such as localized pitting, dissolution, and galvanic corrosion, and stop on the oxide layer. The interconnection materials and the barrier materials are in physical contact, and the polishing slurry provides a conductive pathway between them. According to mixed potential theory, two metals with different potentials are polarized until they reach the same potential, forming a gal- vanic couple. The more noble metal becomes a cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction, and the less noble metal is corroded more rapidly through dissolution/oxidation while supplying electrons to the cathode, resulting in the preferential dissolu- tion/corrosion of either interconnection material or barrier material by galvanic corrosion (Fig. 4) [73]. Corrosion param- eters ( Ecorr,Icorr,Eg, and Ig) obtained from Tafel extrapolations provide useful information on the oxidation \u2013reduction reac- tions of metal films in the slurry. Chemical additives induce the shifts in the Ecorrand the Icorrby the complex mechanism. An upward shift of Tafel curves can occur due to anodic Figure 4: Galvanic corrosion of metal-barrier couple due to their potential difference. The preferential dissolution/corrosion of interconnection materi al and barrier material leads to the dishing and the fang, respectively.Review Journal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 242",
    "corrosion/passivation or cathodic stimulation. A downward shift in Tafel plots is observed with the addition of the cathodic inhibitor by retarding the rate of oxygen transfer to the cathodic sites on the metal films. It is necessary to minimize the potential difference of the metal/barrier couple with low corrosion currents through a careful selection of oxidizer, com- plexing agent, corrosion inhibitor, and the slurry pH. Cu metal and Ru barrier act as the anode and cathode of the galvanic couple, respectively. Galvanic corrosion of Cu \u2013Ru couple needs to be controlled through the selective prevention of cathodic reactions on Ru film, and/or increasing the potential of Cu by preferential anodic inhibition of Cu films. Peethala et al. [74] proposed a silica-based slurry containing 5 mM BTA and 7 mM ascorbic acid at pH 9 in the presence of KIO 4, as an oxidizer as selective anodic and cathodic corrosion inhibitors for Cu and Ru films, respectively. The mixed corro- sion inhibitor system not only minimized the galvanic corrosion of Cu \u2013Ru couple but also achieved a reasonable removal rate selectivity of Cu and Ru films. Chockalingam et al. [75] showed that 2 mM BTA and 3 mM sucrose in the presence of KIO 4at pH 10 were able to suppress both anodic and cathodic reaction of Cu and Mn films by forming a passivation layer on the films, leading to minimizing the individual corrosion of films as well as their galvanic corrosion. Jiang et al. [76] showed that the combi- nation of BTA and Pluronic\u00ae P103 in the presence of KIO 4at pH 9.5 formed a compact passivation layer, composed of Pluronic\u00ae P103 adsorbed on the Cu-BTA complex, resulting in the desired Cu removal rate \u223c200 \u00c5/min with the negligible dissolution and excellent surface quality. This slurry composition was also very effective in the control of the removal rates of Cu, Ru, and low-kdielectric films and their selectivity, but the galvanic cor- rosion of Cu/Ru couple needed to be reduced for improved sur- face quality when Ru is used as the barrier layer. Adsorption Behavior and Mechanism of Slurry Components on Abrasive Particles and Films Organic compounds such as dispersants and passivation agents in CMP slurries have been used to stabilize the slurry and achieve the selective removal of the materials during polishing, respectively. The most common functional groups of disper- sants and passivation agents used in CMP slurries are carbox- ylic acids (COOH) and amines (NH 2). Chemical adsorption between the adsorbate and the surface occurs through various interactions such as electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions [77]. Electrostatic interaction is rele- vant for ionic species and involves the attractive electrostatic forces between opposite charges. Hydrogen bonding occurs when electronegative atoms such as O, S, or N approach a hydrogen atom bound to another electronegative atom. It ispossible for organic compounds containing electronegative groups such as \u2013OH, \u2013O\u2013,\u2013NH, and \u2013NH 2to adsorb onto -OH groups of the hydrated surface of particles and films through hydrogen bonding. Adsorption Behavior and Mechanism of Dispersants on Abrasive Particles Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and copolymers, anionic polymers, have been widely used as dispersants for ceria slurries [78, 79]. When added to the slurry, the COOH groups of PAA are deprotonated to negatively charged COO\u2212groups above its pKa of 4.5 and adsorb on the highly positively charged ceria surface (OH 2+sites) viaelectrostatic attractive interaction and hydrogen bonding [Fig. 5(a)] [80], which increases Figure 5: (a) Schematic illustration depicting PAA interactions at the ceria/ Si3N4\u2013slurry interface as a function of pH and corresponding potential-distance diagrams.

    "electrostatic repulsion as well as steric hindrance between the ceria particles. PAA coated ceria particles are known to undergo transitions of bridging agglomeration-stable-floccula- tion depending on their physicochemical conditions such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration [81]. Citric acid and PAA have been used to disperse alumina abra- sives [82, 83]. Song et al. suggested that the mixed dispersant system of citric acid and PAA was very useful for the stable dis- persion of alumina abrasives, leading to higher Cu removal rates by suppressing the hydration of alumina abrasive [84]. Ionic surfactants such as ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) have been used in the formation of ceria slurries reported by Dylla-Spears et al. [85]. They suggested that the formation of charged micelles above the critical micelle concentration may electro-sterically hinder the agglomeration of ceria particles, which is called the \u201ccharged micelle halo \u201dstabilization mecha- nism [85]. Tseng et al. [86] reported that the silica abrasives in the presence of methyl methacrylate were stabilized by either elec- trostatic barriers or steric barriers between the particles, result- ing in an excellent uniformity of the oxide thickness across the wafer. Pan et al. [87] suggested that sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic surfactant, could improve the dispersion stability of silica-based slurries for Cu CMP. Indeed, free SDS surfactants remaining in the slurry were very useful to suppress Cu corrosion and lead to good surface quality. Polyethylenimine (PEI) and CTAB composed of the amine groups were used to disperse silica abrasive particles also [88, 89]. They can be adsorbed onto the negatively charged silica through electrostatic attractive interaction as well as hydrogen bonding and prevent agglomeration. However, the adsorbed layer on the particle surface results in the low material removal rate by preventing particles from direct contact with the mate- rials to be polished. Adsorption Behavior and Mechanism of Passivation Agents on Films PAA, when used as a passivation agent during polishing, can be preferentially adsorbed on the positively charged Si 3N4film (pH IEP\u223c5\u20137) through electrostatic attraction [Fig. 5(a)] [80], suppressing the removal of Si 3N4film and yielding high selec- tivity [90]. Kim et al. reported that PAA has almost ten times higher affinity with Si 3N4at pH 5 \u20139 than with SiO 2[91]. The preferential adsorption of PAA on Si 3N4films was confirmed by attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectra of SiO 2 and Si 3N4surfaces treated with PAA. Kim et al. measured the thickness of adsorbed PAA on the Si 3N4film using atomic force microscopy as a function of ionic strength [92]. The thickness of the adsorbed PAA layers on the Si 3N4film was5.2, 4.5, and 3.8 nm with 0, 0.2, and 0.4 M KNO 3, respectively. In some case, if the attractive forces such as hydrogen bonding are more dominant than the electrostatic repulsion between PAA and SiO 2film, it is possible for the adsorption of PAA to occur on the SiO 2film [93]. Park et al. investigated the effect of adding both PAA and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) to ceria based slurries to achieve the multi-selectivity between SiO 2,S i3N4, and poly-Si films and showed high selectivity ( \u223c65:\u223c15:1 for SiO 2:Si3N4:poly-Si films) in the presence of 0.05 wt% PAA and 0.2 wt% PVP in the pH range of 6.0 \u20136.5 [94]. Seo et al. proposed the PAA-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) \u201cinterpolymer complexes \u201d as a passivation agent for high selectivity with low dishing and reported that the cross-linked network structure of inter- polymer complexes significantly reduced dishing by preventing abrasives from polishing oxide in the trenches [95]. America and Babu [53] proposed that the COOH group of the amino acid proline can form a bidentate interaction with the Si \u2013OH group on Si 3N4film along with H-bonding between the amino acid and Si 3N4film [Fig. 5(b)]. The bidentate bond- ing is observed where two or more hydrogen bonds are formed with a base or base pair. More generally, many amino acids were able to suppress the removal rates of Si 3N4film through the prevention of the hydrolysis of the Si 3N4as long as there are available in sufficient amounts during polishing. Since amino acids can also be adsorbed on the abrasive particles, free amino acids remaining in the solution must be of sufficient quantity for effective suppression of Si 3N4film removal rates. Since these amino acids are sensitive to a change of pH, the slurry pH needs to be optimized based on their pKa values [54, 96]. Hydrophobic interaction involves the adsorption of the nonpolar groups of organic molecules such as a hydrocarbon backbone ( \u2013CH 2\u2212CH 2\u2212) onto hydrophobic surfaces. Penta et al. [97] investigated four different anionic surfactants and showed that these negatively charged surfactants could prefer- entially adsorb on positively charged Si 3N4film viaelectrostatic interactions. A monolayer of anionic surfactants is formed by electrostatic attraction between surfactants and Si 3N4, followed by a secondary layer by hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic tails of anionic surfactants, suppressing Si 3N4 removal rates. Nonionic surfactants that can preferentially adsorb on the hydrophobic poly-Si surface viahydrophobic interaction for preferential removal of SiO 2over poly-Si were studied by Lee et al. [98], and there was a strong dependence of the selectivity on the hydrophilic \u2013lipophilic balance value and molecular weight of nonionic surfactants. Metal films are prone to dissolve when exposed to reactive components in the slurry, and corrosion inhibitors are added to prevent the corrosion defects such as pitting, cracking, and excessive etching during polishing. Most of the inhibitorsReview Journal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 244",
    "studied for CMP applications are organic compounds contain- ing N, S, and O atoms [99]. A metal cation can interact with aromatic rings containing conjugated bonds, \u03c0electrons, and lone-pair electrons from heteroatoms (O, N, or S). The effi- ciency of heteroatoms in the inhibitor molecules increases in the order of O < N < S. The corrosion inhibition of metal films involves either physisorption or chemisorption of the inhibitor on the metal surface. Electrostatic attractive force between the charged inhibitor molecules and the charged metal surface leads to physisorption. Chemisorption is due to the interaction between unshared electron pairs of the hetero- atom and metal atoms to form coordinate covalent bonds. The standard adsorption free energy ( \u0394G\u00b0ads) can provide insight into the mechanism of corrosion inhibition. The \u0394G\u00b0adsvalues above \u221220 kJ/mol and below \u221240 kJ/mol correspond to the physisorption and chemisorption process, respectively. Anodic inhibitors reduce the corrosion potential of metal films by oxidizing a surface layer and forming a thin passivat- ing film on the metal. Cathodic inhibitors suppress the cathodic reaction (O 2+2 H 2O+4 e\u2212= 4OH\u2212) by retarding the rate of oxygen transfer to the cathodic sites on the metal sur- face. Molecules with aliphatic chains are effective in suppress- ing the corrosion of metal films due to the attraction of nonpolar hydrophobic parts of inhibitor and polar medium [99]. The hydrophobic parts of inhibitors form a protective layer on the metal surface. Their size and molecular weight have an impact on the inhibition efficiency [100]. Larger the molecule, higher inhibition efficiency: R 3N>R 2NH > RNH 2, where R is a hydrocarbon chain. Azole derivatives such as BTA and TAZ have been widely used as corrosion inhibitors for metal films during polishing [Fig. 5(c)] [101, 102, 103]. BTA can be adsorbed onto a Cu film by the coordination of the lone-pair electrons of the N atoms in BTA [Fig. 5(c)] with the Cu atoms on the surface [104, 105]. Xue et al. suggested that BTAH reacts with metallic Cu much faster than on Cu oxide and forms a polymeric pas- sivating layer for Cu film than for copper oxides [105]. Also, they showed that Cu could be oxidized to Cu(I) in the presence of dissolved oxygen and form a Cu(I)BTA complex with BTA: 4Cu + 4BTAH + 2O 2\u2194Cu(I)BTA + 2H 2O [105]. Although surfactants such as CTAB [106], ammonium dodecyl sulfate [65], and potassium oleate [107] were also investigated as corrosion inhibitors, BTA is the most common corrosion inhibitor used in CMP slurries. In any case, all these inhibitors can complex with metal ions and remain stable on the metal film as undesirable organic residues [108], and it has been very difficult to remove these organic residues during post-CMP cleaning [109, 110]. So, post-CMP cleaning has become essential to remove these organic residues from the films while minimizing other defects (e.g., residual particles, foreign materials, scratches, and corrosion). Figure 6 shows asummary of the adsorption of organic compounds such as dis- persants, passivation agents, and inhibitors on the abrasive par- ticles and the wafer surfaces in the CMP system. Temperature Effects The major sources of thermal heating during polishing are fric- tional dissipation and the chemical reactions of slurry compo- nents at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface, leading to a change in temperature. Various thermal models of the polishing process based on kinematics [111], energy generation [112], and a combination of frictional heating and chemical reactivity [113] were proposed. Infrared thermography was used to char- acterize the impact of thermal effects on pad life, polishing rate, and non-uniformity during polishing. Wang et al. [114] reported that the exothermic reaction between the metal sur- face and the oxidizers in the acidic environment could increase the temperature up to 75 \u00b0C during polishing depending on CMP conditions, which was lowered by the slurry flow. White et al. [112] proposed an energy flow mechanism into and out of the process, and an energy balance was used to pre- dict an increase in the slurry temperature during polishing. They suggested that the heat is generated by the mechanical abrasion and the chemical reactions associated with the slurry chemistry and enthalpy is primarily transferred into the polish- ing pad, and then, most of the heat will be removed by convec- tion of slurry flow, conduction, and radiation to the environment [112]. Oh and Seok [113] suggested that frictional heat generated during polishing is transferred to the wafer, pad, and slurry, and plays a key role in accelerating the chemical reactions at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface. Their theoretical results showed that the temperature variation of the wafer, pad, and slurry has an influence on material removal rates. Indeed, the temperature rise of the CMP process not only has an effect on the slurry viscosity, pH, particle size, and zeta- potential [30, 115, 116] but also leads to delamination or peel- off of the metal films [70, 117]. For example, a 5 \u00b0C change in temperature can lead to a 10% drop in slurry viscosity [30]. Kakireddy reported that thin Cu film peeled off during polish- ing at higher temperatures due to lower adhesion and mechan- ical strength [117]. The Effect of Temperature Changes on the Chemical and Mechanical Reactions during Polishing As stated earlier, the scope of this review paper is limited to CMP slurries and related to chemical and mechanical aspects of the CMP process, although other CMP consumables such as pad, pad conditioner, wafer carrier, and retaining ring and CMP conditions need to be considered.

    "simplified scheme of the complex interactions between chemi- cal and mechanical aspects of the CMP process discussed in this review paper. It is important to emphasize that Fig. 7 helps in understanding the complex interactions between chemical and mechanical effects that occur at the pad \u2013wafer \u2013 particle interface during polishing. (i) Case I: The materials or wafers are removed by the synergetic effects of chemical and mechanical interaction during polishing. The energy dissipation due to frictional heating is responsible for increases in the temperaturesdduring polishing. The average temperature of slurry increased up to 75 \u00b0C during the W CMP process, and Wang et al. suggested that the oxidation of W film causes the temperature increase because this reaction is exothermic [114]. Also, in some cases, chemical reactions like the Fenton reaction are spontaneous exothermic processes, contribute to temperature increase during polishing. (ii) Case II: As is well known, with increasing temperature of the system, the rates of chemical reactions increase [118], leading to higher removal rates [116, 119, 120]. Kim et al.Figure 6: An overview of the adsorp- tion of organic compounds such as dispersants, passivation agents, and inhibitors on the abrasive particles and the wafer surfaces.

    "reported that the slurries at higher temperatures lead to the formation of the soft layers on the surface of SiO 2film, and this layer could be easily removed by mechanical abrasion [116, 119]. Mudhivarthi et al. found that an increase in the surface oxidation/dissolution rate of Cu film, resulting in higher Cu removal rates [120]. The corrosion rate of metal films increases with increasing the temperature, leading to a decrease in the inhibition efficiency. Moreover, an increase in temperature not only leads to changes in the polymer chain conformation (coiled transformed to stretched) [121] but also causes changes in the zeta-potentials and the pH IEPof abrasive particles and films [122], which have an influence on the adsorbed amounts and thickness of dispersants and passivation agents. (iii) Case III: Since the formation of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions from water (H 2O\u2194H++OH\u2212)i sa n endothermic process, the water dissociates to H+and OH\u2212 as the temperature increases. The slurry pH decreases with increasing H+concentration at a higher temperature. Kim et al. reported that the change ( \u0394pH) in the pH of silica and ceria slurries as the temperature increased from 20 to 90 \u00b0C was \u223c1.0 and \u223c1.3, respectively [116, 119]. It is well known that a change in pH of slurry has a significant influence on the particle \u2013wafer interactions [123, 124]. Also, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases with increasing temperature [125]. For example, 10.07 mg/L of oxygen can be dissolved in the water at 15 \u00b0C, while 7.54 mg/L of oxygen can be dissolved in the water at 30 \u00b0C [125]. The change in the dissolved oxygen concentrations can affect the oxidation and dissolution process of metal films and the surface chemistry of abrasive particles as well as their mutual interactions [3]. (iv) Case IV: The hydrodynamic size ( Rh) of abrasive particles can be determined by the Stokes \u2013Einstein relation; Rh= kT/6\u03c0\u03b7Dwhere k,T,\u03b7, and Drepresent Boltzmann \u2019s constant, temperature, water viscosity, and the diffusion coefficient. Since the equation includes the viscosity of the fluid medium (in our case, water) and the temperature, both parameters strongly influence on the hydrodynamic size of particles. Indeed, the viscosity of the water \u03b7 decreases with increasing temperature ( Case V ) [126]. Zeta potentials of the abrasive particles increase with temperature. Zeta potentials of particles can be obtained indirectly from the measurement of the electrophoretic mobility according to Henry \u2019s equation; UE=2e\u03b6F(\u03baa)/3\u03b7 where UEis the electrophoretic mobility, eis the relative permittivity of water, and F(\u03baa) is Henry \u2019s function (dimensionless). For particles in an aqueous medium, F(\u03baa) is 1.5 according to the Smoluchowskiapproximation. The variation of zeta potential of abrasive particles with temperature is explained by the known temperature dependence of the viscosity ( \u03b7) and the relative permittivity ( e) of water. Evenhuis et al. reported that experimentally determined values of zeta-potential were directly proportional to the temperature [122]. Kim et al. also showed an increase in the zeta-potentials of commercial ceria slurries with increasing slurry temperatures [116]. It may be possible for the number of active particles that participate in material removal during polishing to be changed depending on the particle size and zeta potentials of the abrasive particles. (v) Case V, VI, and VII: The viscosity of the slurry is a measure of its resistance to deformation by shear forces. High slurry viscosity impedes the transport of the slurry components across the wafer surface. As the temperature of liquid increases, the viscosity of slurry decreases ( Case V), and the reactant molecules move faster ( Case VI ). Also, according to the Stribeck curve [Fig. 2(b)] [27, 28], a decrease in the slurry viscosity at a higher temperature may allow the direct contact between two solid films with a thin slurry film thickness resulting in an increase in COF during polishing. In Situ Techniques to Study the Phenomena that Occur at the Slurry/pad \u2013wafer Interface during Polishing Research in the field of CMP has significantly increased, as the semiconductor industry grows. Numerous experimental tech- niques have been employed to understand particle \u2013film\u2013 wafer interactions, but they are not adapted for in situ and real- time detection during polishing due to their dimensions and operating requirements. The actual CMP system includes the mutual interactions between chemical and mechanical effects. In situ measurement data collected during polishing are likely to provide more important insights into the underlying mech- anisms of various complex reactions that occur at the slurry/ pad\u2013wafer interface. This section offers an overview of advances in the research and developments of in situ measure- ment studies in CMP systems and then discusses the challenges associated with these measurements. Table 2 presents a sum- mary of in situ measurements applied in CMP systems while highlighting the main applications for each technique. Slurry film thickness was in situ monitored by analyzing the fluorescence intensities of the two different dye molecules in the slurry using a dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence technique with a dual-camera imaging system [Fig. 2(a); Table 2] as described in the Hydrodynamic lubrication sectionReview Journal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 247",
    "[23, 24]. Mueller et al. [127] used tracer particles to study fluid flow characteristics over pad asperities and recorded a video at 30 frames/s using high definition camera to obtain in situ slurry fluid flow data during polishing (Table 2) and manually analyzed the qualitative information of the slurry flow charac- teristics from the video. This tool and method enable to study wafer-scale slurry flow visualization depending on CMP condi- tions, slurry injection locations, and various pad types [127]. The studies that used dyes or tracer particles contain valuable information on slurry film thickness and flow characteristics [23, 24, 127]. However, these particles added to the slurry may not only have a significant influence on the chemical and mechanical reactions during polishing but also become embedded in the pad due to the hydrophobic interactions [127]. Moreover, the materials to be polished are limited to transparent glasses over UV and visible regions. In situ rheo-polishing setup with a parallel-plate geometry was developed by Crawford et al. [Fig. 8(a); Table 2] [34]. The top was constructed of a disposable plate, while a 2-in diameter SiO 2blanket wafer was inserted into the fixture housing with 2 mL of slurry. The gap between the top plate and the wafer surface was 30 \u03bcm, which allowed for shear rates up to 200, 000 s\u22121. In some cases, shear-induced aggregation of particles, less than 2% of the total number of particles, was found at a high shear rate ( \u226510,000 s\u22121). Shear thickened samples gener- ated about seven times more scratches on the wafer surface than non-thickened slurries. However, as they mentioned, this method not only has no applied normal force but also is incapable of measuring the real changes in slurry viscosity with rolling friction [34]. Takaya et al. have developed a custom-built Raman spec- trometer to study various interactions of Cu-abrasive, abrasive- peroxide, BTA-peroxide, and BTA-abrasive-peroxide (Table 2) [128]. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) systemis an amplification technique that enhances Raman signal from molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces. 25 nm thick Cu film deposited on 10 mm glass was used as a substrate for SERS measurements, and it is immersed in the glass cell filled with the slurry. Their SERS analysis results for BTA-abrasive-peroxide suggested that both Cu-BTA and Cu (II)-fullerenol-complex layers are formed on the Cu surface simultaneously, and these layers may inhibit the further inter- actions of chelating agents and oxidizer with Cu film [128]. However, this method is also limited to only chemical reactions without mechanical effects. Since the actual metal polishing system includes the kinetics of competitive reactions between oxidizer, chelating agent, and inhibitor when the passivating layers were removed by mechanical abrasion, mechanical abra- sion and slurry flow system, which need to be considered to get more realistic results. The ATR-FTIR technique for the in situ characterization of CMP using micro-structured single reflection elements (mSREs) was developed by U. K\u00fcnzelmann and H. Schumacher (Table 2) [129]. They fabricated the micro- structure, consists of a periodic array of V-shaped grooves on the backside of a double-side polished 4-in Si wafer with 525\u03bcm thickness by wet etch in hot KOH solution, which is mSRE. This element not only enables to provide single reflec- tion ATR measurement without any collimation but also covers the entire mid-infrared region with a high optical throughput due to the short light path [129]. The coupling structures of the mSRE face downwards, and the pad is pressed from its upper side and rotated against the static mSRE, while the slurry was injected between at the wafer \u2013pad interface. With the depth around 1 \u03bcm, this technique enables to an in situ analysis of the deposition, etching, and surface modification of wafer, pad, and abrasives during polishing [129]. In situ ATR-FTIR spectra of the actual CMP system are very complex and thusTABLE 2. Summary of in situ techniques studies in CMP systems.

    "result in the overlapping absorptions between the main compo- nents such as a wafer, pad, and abrasives, which is a major chal- lenge to be addressed by researchers. Kimura et al. showed that the movement of the particles located at the glass \u2013pad interface could be imaged in situ using evanescent wave (EW) microscopy [Fig. 8(b); Table 2] [130]. EW microscopy, also known as total internal reflection microscopy, coupled with video microscopy was employed to follow the movements of particles near the glass \u2013pad interface. In their experimental setup, an EW was generated when the laser light beam having 30 mW power at 632 nm wavelength (He\u2013Ne laser) undergoes total internal reflection at a glass \u2013 slurry interface and propagated parallel to the surface with an exponentially decaying intensity [130]. The EW illuminates the particles present in the slurry and has a penetration depth ( \u223c100 nm) in an imaged area of 480 \u00d7 640 mm2. The frame rate of the digital high-speed video camera was60 frames/s (fps). They suggested that the abrasive particles adhered to the Si(OH) 4layer on the SiO 2film were removed by slurry flow, which yields the material removal. They also reported that the actual contact area between the pad and the wafer is less than 2%, and suggested that the significant mate- rial removal is caused due to the non-contact lubrication effect [132]. Since Kimura et al. showed a home-built EW imaging system coupled with polishing setup, many research groups have developed different methods to monitor in situ and in real-time the interactions between particle, pad, and wafer dur- ing post-CMP cleaning as well as polishing [133, 134]. Abrasive particles move far away rapidly from the glass surface by the slurry flow and the platen rotation and sometimes disappear from the field of view, preventing long-term particle tracking in the EW field. Moreover, the smaller particles, less than 100 nm particles used in the actual CMP system, scatter less light making them more challenging to detect using EW Figure 8: (a) Rheo-polishing setup with plate fixture and 40 mm upper plate, and schematic of the cross-sectional view of the rheometer plate and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) wafer covered with CMP slurry.

    "microscopy [135]. Thus, more light needs to be collected by the objective lens to make the imaging of smaller particles possible. Local material removal phenomena were in situ observed by infrared thermography (Table 2) [131]. Frictional heating is responsible for increases in the temperature during polishing. Data were obtained from an infrared image sensor with the infra- red light collected through a small hole fabricated on the wafer carrier during polishing. An increase in the temperature is related to material removal efficiency. The feasibility of the in situ obser- vation of the polishing efficiency was confirmed by the polishing experiment with a polishing pad. According to Isobe \u2019sp o l i s h i n g model [136], they suggested that the in situ detection of instanta- neous temperature variations depending on Feret \u2019sd i a m e t e r so f the contact area between the pad and the wafer, leading to higher material removal rate [131]. As they mentioned, it is very difficult to directly measure the change in the temperature at the particle \u2013 wafer \u2013pad interface due to the limitation of the proposed method. Also, the system needs to apply fresh slurry to the pad\u2013wafer interface and remove warm slurry after polishing that passed under the carrier to avoid heat accumulation. Roy\u2019s group reported an electrochemical measurement cou- pled with a Struers Benchtop Polisher [60]. The top part of the system contains a 1-in diameter coupon wafer as a working electrode embedded in a Teflon holder attached to the polish- ing head. And the bottom part is a Teflon container attached to the platen. Electrical connection to the working electrode and the counter electrode was made through carbon brushes pressed against Cu ring surrounding Teflon holder (Top) and Teflon container (bottom), respectively. The reference electrode equipped with a salt bridge connects to the electrolyte. This system enables to in situ measure OCP transients and potentio- dynamic polarization for the metal film under controlled tribo- logical conditions. Roy \u2019s group demonstrated that the tribology and mechanical abrasion affects various catalytic reactions of Cu, Ru, Ta, and Co surfaces during polishing by evaluating CMP systems in the tribo-electrochemical approach [60, 137, 138]. In situ measurements are taken in real-time during polish- ing and can be interpreted immediately. Moreover, in situ mea- surements can give more representative information of CMP slurry characteristics, including various chemical and mechan- ical actions that occur at the slurry/pad \u2013wafer interface during polishing when compared with the ex situ analysis of CMP slurries. However, as stated above, there are still several limita- tions that need to be addressed. Additional studies and in situ techniques will be helpful to understand the underlying mech- anism taking place during the CMP process. Challenges and Future Directions (i)Development of CMP slurries for new materials and integration schemes: As the scaling of the devicedimensions runs into physical limitations, 3D integration, 3D NAND technology, and FinFET structure were employed by using new materials and processes [139, 140]. As the architectures have changed from 2D planar to 3D vertical, new CMP steps involving new materials and complex 3D structures were proposed. Successful implementation of these schemes required developing novel CMP slurries and other consumables to achieve a range of tunable polish rates for new materials based on their characteristics such as stoichiometry, surface chemistry, hardness, chemical inertness or sensitivity, and thickness. A systematic and effective approach needs to be adopted to achieve the necessary high polishing performance, selective polishing, high planarity, low defects, etc. The research strategies, suggested by the author, for developing next-generation CMP slurries, are summarized in Fig. 9. (ii)Defect reduction and post-CMP cleaning : Devices at 7 nm node and beyond present even more stringent requirements for the level of acceptable defectivity during the CMP process. The processes become more defect sensitive and require more expensive metrology techniques with appropriate optical resolution to detect the smaller defects. CMP-induced defects caused by residual particles, foreign materials, scratches, corrosion, etc. should be avoided during polishing. Since this is not always possible, post-CMP cleaning has become a crucial step to eliminate many of these defects [141, 142, 143, 144]. Recently, the author not only showed that the rupture of a strong chemical bonding between abrasive particles and the SiO 2films viaa nucleophilic attack could help remove the particles from the surface [141] but also reported a stability constant-based strategy to study reagents that can remove Cu-BTA and Co-BTA complexes from various surfaces (Cu, Co, TaN, and SiO 2films) [109, 110]. Fundamental understanding of the formation and characterization of various types of CMP-induced defects will immensely benefit the development of next-generation CMP slurries and post-CMP cleaning solutions. (iii) Development of environmentally friendly CMP slurries: Azoles such as BTA and TAZ are not only poorly biodegradable under wastewater treatment conditions but also lead to watermarks on the wafer surfaces and contamination of various surfaces under CMP conditions. The effluent wastewater from a semiconductor fabrication plant may contain high concentrations of azoles, etc., and will be challenging for wastewater treatment processes. Hence, the chemical additives that effectively passivate metal surfaces and exhibit sufficiently high biodegradation rates need to be considered keeping their environmental impact in mind.Review Journal ofMateria lsResear ch www .mrs .org/jmr Volume 36 Issue 1 January 2021 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021, published on behalf of Materials Research Society by Cambridge University Press 2021 250",
    "(iv) Toxicity issues and safety considerations [145, 146] Toxic gases (e.g., PH 3, AsH 3) and the As containing waste slurries can be generated during the polishing of III \u2013V materials such as GaAs, InGaAs, InAs, and InP. Hence, the goal of the polishing of III \u2013V materials should be achieving high planarity without generating toxic by-products. In the acidic pH, Ru film can be converted to highly volatile RuO 4, a toxic gas. The addition of complexing agents such as carboxylic acids can help to reduce gas evolution during polishing. This is an example of tailoring slurry chemistry to minimize the formation of toxic by-products through a careful selection of oxidizer, complexing agent, corrosion inhibitor, and the slurry pH. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), a strong organic base, is also one of the materials showing a high level of concern. TMAH has been widely used as a developer, cleaning agent, pH adjuster, and etchant in the semiconductor industry, but it can cause fatal damage to nerves and muscles in a short period after exposure by contact [147]. Hence, there has been increasing demand to develop less toxic substitutes for TMAH and improve/control the use of TMAH. As stated earlier, the challenges and future research directions discussed here were related to CMP slurries and related to chemical and mechanical aspects of the CMP process. There has been significant progress in understanding the fundamental science and technology of CMP for the past several decades. Nevertheless, most of the models, methodologies, and tech- niques generally use laboratory-scale model systems under the assumptions about process parameters, which may ormay not be relevant to explain high-volume-production fab- based CMP processes [148]. A close collaboration between aca- demic and industrial R&D will help us to move forward with understanding the fundamental principles and technologies of the actual CMP process by minimizing the gaps between lab- based CMP models and fab-based CMP processes.

We have focused on the e\ufb00ects of particle size distribution, the large-particle size, and the dispersion stability in a ceria slurry. We determined the optimum bead size for milling and appropriatecalcination temperatures in order to obtain a reasonable particle distribution, with lower numbers of \ufb01ne primary particles and large, agglomerated particles, in ceria slurry. This was achieved by reducing the quantity of aggregated particles during milling and two-step calcination process generating higher-density particles. These results can be qualitatively explained byabrasive collisions occurring between the milling beads and the decarbonation of cerium carbonate through di\ufb00usion during the manufacturing process used for the ceria slurry. [DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.46.7671 ] KEYWORDS: calcination, milling, light point defect, ceria slurry, STI-CMP 1. Introduction The shallow-trench isolation (STI) process in advanced semiconductor device manufacturing uses chemical\u2013mechanical polishing (CMP) to planarize gap-\ufb01ll siliconoxide (SiO 2) layers deposited on the front-side surface of a wafer.1\u20134)As device dimensions continue to decrease and the leading-edge feature size becomes smaller than 0.1 mm, STI- CMP must be capable of removing a very thin layer of oxideand nitride while leaving a \ufb02at surface. In STI-CMP, theselectivity of the removal rates of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms is acritical factor. Moreover, as the oxide and nitride layersbecome thinner, not only the nitride removal rate but alsothe numbers of micro-scratches and defects should be controlled more strictly to improve the device character- istics. To improve the selectivity, ceria slurries with anionicsurfactants have been used. 3,4,8,11)The anionic surfactant is adsorbed onto the nitride \ufb01lm and acts as a passivation layer,thereby the nitride removal rate is decreased. 13,14,17) Not only the surfactant characteristics but also the abrasive characteristics are critical issues for STI-CMP ceriaslurries. Generally, the \ufb01lm removal rate and the number of surface defects decrease as the abrasive size is reduced, because the mechanical force between the pressed pad andthe abrasive particles is weakened. 14)While STI-CMP with smaller abrasive particles leads to a lower number of surfacedefects, it also leads to other unpredictable e\ufb00ects, such asan increase in the nitride removal rate caused by extrasurfactant consumption due to the higher speci\ufb01c surfacearea of the small particles in the slurry. 17)Therefore, during the synthesis of the ceria slurry, controlling small particles and obtaining a narrow particle size distribution areimportant factors a\ufb00ecting the oxide-to-nitride removalselectivity. The calcination process is widely used to controlthe physical characteristics of ceria particles in slurry,including the speci\ufb01c surface area, density, and crystallin-ity, 11)which greatly a\ufb00ects STI-CMP performance. Specif- ically, the e\ufb00ect of the two-step calcination reported by our group shows the ability to control the slurry characteristicsby calcination.17)Abrasive particles calcined by two-step calcination are harder and denser, and have a narrowerdistribution of primary grain size, without large grains thatcause microscratches and small primary grains that triggerthe agglomeration of colloidal particles, even though theparticles have the same grain and secondary particle sizes as these in slurry calcined by one-step calcination. Using these particles, we can improve STI-CMP performance, namely,higher oxide removal rate, higher oxide-to-nitride selectiv-ity, and fewer defects. Moreover, the milling process is usedto disperse agglomerates and aggregates and to control theparticle size distribution and the shapes of the abrasiveparticles. 5,6)In particular, the size of the beads used for milling is very important for obtaining abrasive particles in the submicron size range. The applied energy intensity and the rate of stress application in the milling machine alsoa\ufb00ect the particle size and size distribution. 18,19) In this study, we investigated the e\ufb00ects of the calcination temperature to study the characteristics of two-step calcina-tion when we manufacture a ceria abrasive from STI-CMPslurry. Moreover, to control the proportions of large and \ufb01neparticles, which cause microscratches by agglomeration, we investigated the e\ufb00ects of bead size during the milling process after two-step calcination. In addition, we evaluatedSTI-CMP performance using these slurries. 2. Experimental Procedure In this study, three types of ceria particles were synthe- sized from a starting material of high-purity ceriumcarbonate using the solid-state displacement reaction meth- od. One type of ceria powder was calcined using the one- step calcination method, whereas the other samples werecalcined using a two-step calcination method. In the case ofone-step calcination, the carbonate precursor was calcinedonly once at 730 /C14C for 4 h. In the case of two-step calcination, the ceria particles were obtained through anadditional calcination at 550 or 580 /C14C for 4 h, after initial calcination at 650 or 680/C14C, respectively, for 4 h. In addition, between the \ufb01rst and second calcination steps, the ceria particles were crushed with a dry mechanicalcrusher called an air jet mill.

    "ceria particles calcined at 680/C14C for 4 h before and after the crushing, respectively. To summarize, the powders calcinedin two steps were calcined for a longer period of time and at a lower temperature than those calcined in the conventional manner. In previous studies, we simply explained that thetwo-step calcination method, in which ceria abrasiveparticles have an advantage during calcination showinghigh density and low porosity without abnormal graingrowth in manufacturing process of the ceria slurry. 17)In this investigation, however, we focused on not only the two-stepcalcination process but also the media size during milling process in ceria slurry manufacturing. In addition, we have con\ufb01rmed the di\ufb00erence in calcination temperature toimprove the remaining particles and the nitride \ufb01lm losswhile a reasonable oxide removal rate is maintained afterCMP. A detailed discussion is provided below. After the calcination and dry crushing of each powder, the two-step powder calcined at 680 and 580 /C14C was further crushed by wet mechanical bead milling with di\ufb00erent bead sizes of 0.8, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 mm, made of ZrO 2, for 3 to 5 h to reduce its secondary particle size to the target size rangeof 250\u2013300 nm. In contrast, the other two-step powder(calcined at 650 and 550 /C14C) and the one-step powder were milled using only 0.3 mm beads. The ceria abrasives werethen dispersed in deionized water and stabilized by adding100 ppm of a commercially available dispersant [poly-(methacrylate acid)]. The solid content was controlled at 5 wt % of ceria powder in the ceria suspension. We also optionally added an anionic organic surfactant [poly(acry-lic acid)] at di\ufb00erent concentrations of up to 0.8 wt %. Thissurfactant is generally used to control the oxide-to-nitride selectivity with regard to removal rates. Each slurry\u2019s pHwas adjusted to the range of 6.5\u20137.5 by adding an alkalineagent. Table I shows a list of the slurry speci\ufb01cations,including the slurry pH values, abrasive sizes, and theexperimental conditions used during slurry synthesis. The median size of the secondary particles in each slurry was measured by using a Horiba LA910. 10)We obtained images of the ceria particles and measured the primaryparticle sizes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),using a JEOL JEM-2010. The speci\ufb01c surface areas of thepowders were estimated through Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller(BET) method, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010. Thepowder densities were measured with a pyconometer, namely, an Micromeritics Accupyc 1330, after the samples were outgassed at 250 /C14C for 2 h using nitrogen gas to remove physisorbed species from the powder surface. To investigate the e\ufb00ect the calcination process on STI- CMP performance, CMP evaluation tests were carried outwith commercial 8 00wafers covered with plasma-enhanced tetraethylorthosilicate (PETEOS) or low-pressure chemical-vapor deposition (LPCVD) nitride \ufb01lms. The thicknesses of the as-deposited oxide and nitride \ufb01lms were 7000 and 1500 A \u02da, respectively. We polished the \ufb01lms on a Strasbaugh 6EC and carried out ex situ conditioning with a diamond dresser before each polishing. We used a Rodel IC1000/Suba IV stacked pad. The polishing pressure, applied as adown force, was 4 psi, equivalent to 27.5 kPa. The relativevelocity between the pad and the wafers was 0.539 m/s. Thepolishing times were 30 s for the oxide \ufb01lms and 90 s for the nitride \ufb01lms. We measured the oxide and nitride thickness variations of the wafers before and after CMP with aNanometrics NanoSpec 180. The variations in the locationand number of light point defects (LPDs) were measuredusing the stationary beam technology and optional bright\ufb01eld channel of a KLA-Tencor Surfscan SP1. The minimumdetection size for LPDs was adjusted to 0.189 mm. 3. Results and Discussion Figure 2 shows the correlation between the median size (d50) of the secondary particles and the milling time with various bead sizes for the two-step powder calcined at 680and 580 /C14C, after dispersion in deionized water. The median size was markedly reduced as the milling time increased. Inaddition, the smaller bead sizes required signi\ufb01cantly shortermilling times than did the largest bead size of 0.8 mm. During the milling process, the secondary particle size is reduced by collision between milling bead and abrasiveparticle. In addition, the shape and size of fractured particle (a) (b) Fig. 1.

    "should be determined by bead size and milling energy, the milling time, and other characteristics of the milling media,if the other parameters of the milling machine are \ufb01xed. Inparticular, the probability of fracture is higher when thefrequency of collisions is higher. We assume that if the otherparameters except of the bead size are \ufb01xed, then the collision frequency per unit volume in the milling machine increases rapidly, as the media size decreases and the mediavelocity increases. 5)Coarser media have a large spacing with respect to the slurry powder. Thus the collision frequencyand contact probability between the beads and the secondaryabrasive particles are much lower than those with \ufb01nermedia; accordingly, the secondary particle size is reducedslowly. On the other hand, smaller media have a small spacing with respect to the powder; thus the collision frequency and the probability of fracture are higher, and thesecondary particle size is reduced more rapidly. Therefore,as shown by our results, by increasing the milling time, themedian size of the secondary abrasives was graduallydecreased to within the target range of 250\u2013300 nm evenwith the largest bead size. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the primary grain size for the ceria abrasives calcined at 680 and 580 /C14C, without surfactant addition. The grain sizes were analyzed statisti-cally (30 grains for each set of conditions), and the averagevalues were calculated for various bead sizes. Although the secondary abrasive size was \ufb01xed in the target range of 250\u2013300 nm, the primary grain size became smaller and had a narrower distribution as the bead size increased. Never-theless, because the coarsest beads (0.8 mm) have a largerspacing with respect to the powder, the milling timeincreased as the secondary particle size was slowly reduced,whereas with the smaller bead sizes, the abrasive size wasmarkedly reduced by the beads, which have a smallerspacing with respect to the powder. The beads must not be too small, however, because they must impart su\ufb03cient mechanical energy to the particles to cause fracture. In beadmilling, for a given volume, the number of balls increasesinversely with the cube of the bead radius. 21)The milling rate depends on the number of contact points between theballs and the powder, which in turn depends on the speci\ufb01csurface area of the balls. As shown in Fig. 3, many \ufb01neparticles (smaller than 10 nm) were produced after milling with the 0.8 and 0.4 mm beads, had small speci\ufb01c surface areas and aggregated around larger particles in order toreduce the total surface energy, thus promoting agglomer-ation. Such agglomeration reduces the surface potentialand stabilizes the slurry system. Hence, \ufb01ne particles canexcessively consume the anionic dispersant and surfactantfrom the bulk suspension, causing the adsorbed polymerlayer on the nitride \ufb01lm to be insu\ufb03ciently formed. Therefore, in slurry manufacturing, \ufb01ne particle control is a very important consideration in size reduction induced bybead size control. Varinot et al. previously reported that three milling mechanisms in a stirred bead mill produce di\ufb00erent phasesin the resulting particle distribution, as shown schematicallyin Fig. 4. 18)They explained that if the size of the grinding beads is increased or the solid concentration is increased, then fracture becomes dominant with respect to abrasion.18) Then, under the same conditions, if the applied energy and the rate of stress are constant, the milling mechanism isdetermined by the hardness of the particles in the slurrysuspension. When the particle hardness is high, the localsurface stress is relatively lower than that needed tofragment the particle. Abrasion then becomes the dominantmechanism; thus the particles are not fractured but only milled at their edges. None of these di\ufb00erent mechanisms occur alone, however, they are always found in combinationwith one another. Hence, we consider that the e\ufb00ects of the bead size and the milling time on the size distribution of the secondaryabrasive particles are probably directly related. Therefore,the size distribution may be strongly a\ufb00ected by the millingmechanism. In this study, in the case of the slurry milled with 0.2 mm beads, the average particle distribution was shifted to a large size as compared with the slurries milledwith larger beads, even though the milling time was shorter.On the other hand, the primary grain particles of the slurrymilled with 0.3 mm beads were larger than those in the otherslurries, because cleavage was the dominant mechanismreducing the particle size. Both the \ufb01ne and coarse particlesin the slurry were reduced more in size using optimally sized 0.3 mm beads and an appropriate milling time. We previously reported the physical characteristics of ceria particles with respect to calcination temperature. 11)Astarget size (250~300 nm) 00 5 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 04 55 0200300400500600700800900median size [nm]0.8 mm bead 0.4 mm bead 0.3 mm bead 0.2 mm bead milling time [h] Fig. 2.

    "the calcination temperature increases, the crystallinity and grain size of ceria particles increase, because of grain growth during calcination as atomic di\ufb00usion causes the wetting of the grain boundaries of adjacent grains. These results explainnot only the increase in the particle density but also theincreasing hardness of the particles. Figure 5 shows high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of abrasive particlesmilled with 0.3 mm beads after calcination using each of thethree processes. As these images indicate, the ceria abrasiveshad a well-de\ufb01ned morphology and the average size of the primary grains composing the abrasives, as measured from the TEM images, ranged approximately from 30\u201350 nm. Asshown by these images, the primary grains of the ceriaabrasives calcined at 650 and 550 /C14C (a) and 680 and 580/C14C (b) were smaller than those of the abrasives calcined onlyat 730 /C14C (c). Kosynkin et al. previously reported that the oxidation reaction of the cerium carbonate precursor tosynthesis the ceria particles, consisting of decarbonation and crystal growth, is not always completed at a speci\ufb01c temperature and that both the decarbonation and crystalgrowth are more e\ufb03cient in di\ufb00erent temperature ranges. 20) In fact, at a lower calcination temperature, the e\ufb03ciency ofthe decarbonation of cerium carbonate is high, while thecrystal growth rate is low. At a higher temperature, however,the relationship is reversed i.e., slow decarbonation andrapid crystal growth. Therefore, during calcination at a low temperature, the density increases rapidly while the grain size increases slowly, since most of the energy is used notfor crystal growth but for decarbonation. Thus, by control-ling decarbonation and crystal growth, it is possible to obtaindense, hard, uniform-sized particles, with uniform-sizedprimary grains. During calcination at a high temperature of730 /C14C in the one-step process, on the other hand, the primary grain size increases rapidly, since the grains combine with each other to stabilize themselves by reducing the total surface energy. As a consequence, the one-stepslurry had primary grains larger than 100 nm, which werelarger than those of the two-step calcined slurries. However,its density was lower, because the core of the large primarygrains reacts more slowly than the outer part of the particlesand thus cannot be calcined completely. Additionally, in case of the ceria abrasives calcined at 680 and 580 /C14C had the lowest number of primary grains consisting of \ufb01ne particles less than 10 nm in size. By thetwo-step calcination, it would be possible to generate dense (c)(b)(a) Fig. 5.

    "particles with a higher degree of synthesis than one-step calcined abrasive, has lower agglomerated large particle and \ufb01ne primary grains.17)Even though the ceria abrasives were synthesized by the same two-step calcination (650/550/C14C and 680/580/C14C), there is a di\ufb00erence in the proportion of \ufb01ne particles. Furthermore, with the ceria abrasives calcinedat 730 /C14C, it is more produced the large secondary particle by agglomeration of many number of \ufb01ne primary grains lessthan 10 nm by calcinations process with high temperature. Itis thought that two-step calcined abrasive particle, which was calcined at a low temperature, had less large grains than one-step calcined abrasive. Hence, the \ufb01ne particles pro-duced by collision between milling beads and abrasiveparticle during milling process, which was made the broaderdistribution of particle size. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the primary grain sizes of the ceria abrasives for all three slurries after milling with0.3 mm beads, before dispersant addition. The primary grain size of the ceria particles is reduced through the mechanical milling process, although initially all the particles are thesame size. The primary grain size had a slightly broaderdistribution for the one-step slurry, and the proportion oflarge particles was also higher than that for the two-stepslurries. Hence, we concluded that the crystallinity of theone-step sample was higher than that of the other samples;the particles in this case were broken through edge grinding during the milling process caused by the abrasion mecha- nism explained above. Regarding the primary grain size ofthe two-step slurry calcined at low temperatures (650 and550 /C14C), however, the primary particles have a lower crystallinity and are easily broken by the dominant fracturemechanism, because these particles have a lower hardnessthan those calcined at higher temperatures. On the otherhand, for the medium-sized abrasives calcined at 680 and 580 /C14C, the cleavage mechanism is dominant, because of the appropriate surface stress and mechanical force between themilling media and the abrasive polycrystalline ceria par-ticles. Therefore, the ceria abrasive calcined at 680 and580 /C14C has fewer \ufb01ne particles smaller than 10 nm in size. By controlling the calcination temperature and the bead sizeof the milling process, we can obtain ceria particles havingfewer \ufb01ne particles smaller than 10 nm in size. In STI-CMP, the removal rates of the oxide and nitride \ufb01lms, the selectivity, uniformity, and LPD formation aregenerally a\ufb00ected by several factors, including the abrasivemorphology, grain size, secondary particle size, and particle size distribution. We previously reported the e\ufb00ects ofagglomerated particles on LPD formation, removal rate, and removal selectivity. 8,9)As the number of agglomerated particles increases, the number of LPDs increases.

    "removal rates of the oxide and nitride \ufb01lms and the LPD counts on the oxide surfaces. The oxide removal rate usuallydepends on the primary grain size, as shown in Fig. 6. As thegrain size increases, the oxide removal rate also increases,whereas the nitride removal rate remains almost the constantwhen the concentration of the additive is above a criticalvalue. 13\u201315)We previously reported a removal mechanism for an oxide \ufb01lm with a ceria slurry.12)In this mechanism, the kinematical energy of the abrasives is the dominant factor in oxide polishing; that is, the abrasive size, polishingpressure, relative velocity between the table and the head,and other factors a\ufb00ect the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm. 12,14) The nitride removal rate of the slurry calcined in one-stepprocess was lower than that of the other samples, and thetwo-step slurry showed a slightly higher nitride removalrate; speci\ufb01cally the slurry calcined at 650 and 550 /C14C showed the highest removal rate. We previously reported the relationship between the molecular weight of PAA and theoxide-to-nitride selectivity in STI-CMP. 22)PAA is adsorbed on both the oxide and nitride \ufb01lms, but it is more stronglyadsorbed onto the nitride \ufb01lm; thus, a denser passivationlayer is formed as the molecular weight of PAA increases.That is the nitride removal rate was a\ufb00ected by the amountof PAA adsorbed onto \ufb01lm. The result of nitride removal rate can be explained by this mechanism. As shown in Fig. 8, which is discussed below in detail, with an increasein calcination temperature, the surface area of the slurrydecreases. Moreover, with an increase in surface area, theparticles consume more PAA molecules. Thus, the particlescan excessively consume the surfactant from the bulksuspension, causing the adsorbed polymer layer on thenitride \ufb01lm to be insu\ufb03ciently formed. 16)Consequently, the nitride removal rate increases with the proportion of surface area, resulting in poor oxide-to-nitride removal selectivity.Therefore, as the calcination temperature increases, theremoval selectivity increases. The number of LPDs, how-ever, increased drastically for the slurry calcined at 730 /C14C, as shown in Fig. 7(c). As noted above, we previouslyreported the e\ufb00ects of agglomerated particles on the removalrates of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms. 9)These agglomerated particles cause many LPDs after polishing.8)In this study, the slurry calcined at 730/C14C had not only more agglom- erated particles but also more primary grains larger than100 nm in size, as shown in Fig. 5(c). It is consider that these agglomerated particles and large grains cause the formation of many LPDs. As discussed above, with an increase in calcination temperature, the oxide-to-nitride removal selec-tivity increases, and the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lmdecreases, however, the number of LPDs increases. Figure 8 shows the speci\ufb01c surface area and the density of the slurry particles after drying the synthesized powder. Thedensities of the two-step samples were higher than that of theone-step sample, and speci\ufb01c surface area showed the same tendency. This means that the ceria particles of the two-step samples were denser and harder (less porous), because ofthe higher degree of synthesis, than those of the one-stepsample. However, in our experiment, the oxide removal ratewas a\ufb00ected more by primary grain size than by hardness ofthe particles, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7(a). Moreover, thenitride removal rates were di\ufb00erent, that the selectivity forthe one-step sample was better than that for the two-step samples. As noted above, however, it is considered that the agglomerated particles and large grains cause the formationof many LPDs. Therefore, to improve the STI-CMPperformance, ceria slurries with large proportions of both\ufb01ne and agglomerated large particles should be carefullycontrolled using an optimum bead size during milling. 4. Conclusions We investigated the e\ufb00ects of calcination and milling process conditions during ceria slurry synthesis on \ufb01lmremoval and the formation of LPDs. During a continuousmechanical milling process after calcination, \ufb01ne particleswere formed with a longer milling time using coarser beads.The slurries with many \ufb01ne particles excessively consumedthe surfactant in the bulk suspension and formed agglom-erates because of the particles\u2019 large speci\ufb01c surface area. In our experiments, we found that the optimum bead size was 0.3 mm with a two-step process of calcination at 680 and580 /C14C. This approach generated a appropriate particle distribution in the ceria slurry, with lower levels of \ufb01neprimary grains and large agglomerated particles, becauseduring the milling process, the abrasive particles werebroken predominantly through a cleavage mechanism.Hence, the nitride removal rate was di\ufb00erent value in this case, meaning better selectivity with a larger primary grain size and more agglomerated particles for slurries calcinedin one step than for slurries calcined in two steps. Theagglomerated particles and large grains, however, causedthe formation of many LPDs. Therefore, to improve STI-CMP performance, ceria slurries with large proportions ofboth \ufb01ne and agglomerated large particles should becarefully controlled by using an optimum bead size during milling.

    "Changing the calcination temperature to tune the microstructure and polishing properties of ceria octahedrons \u2020 Yongxiu Li,abXueliang Wang,aLinmin Ding,aYao Li,aRucheng Heaand Jing Li *ab Ceria octahedrons with di \ufb00erent microstructure and surface characteristics were prepared by calcining an octahedral CeO 2precursor self-assembled from spherical primary nanocrystals of about 5 nm at 500 \u2013 900/C14C. Structural characterization revealed that with the calcination temperature increasing from 500 to 700/C14C, the products maintained a hierarchical structure and primary nanocrystals changed from spherical to octahedral particles. Signi \ufb01cant fusion occurred between the primary nanocrystals and the surface of the octahedrons became smooth at the calcination temperature of 800/C14C. Single crystal CeO 2octahedrons were formed when the calcination temperature reached 900/C14C. The change in microstructure induced by elevated calcination temperature led to increased mechanical hardness anddecreased surface chemical activity (speci \ufb01c surface area and surface Ce 3+concentration) of the octahedrons, which had an impact on their polishing performance. The polishing experiments on K9glass showed that the polishing rate \ufb01rst increased and then decreased with the increment of calcination temperature, indicating that in addition to the mechanical hardness, the surface chemical activity of the octahedrons is also important for material removal. Owing to the best matching of chemical activity and mechanical hardness, CeO 2octahedrons calcinated at 700/C14C exhibited the highest polishing rate and the best surface quality for K9 glass. Introduction Ceria is an important rare earth functional material that is widely used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors,catalysts, ultraviolet absorbents, biological \ue103elds and polishing materials. 1\u20137As a polishing material, ceria has many advan- tages, such as high polishing rate, little damage to the polishedsurface, good surface quality a \ue09der polishing and high removal selectivity, and therefore, has been used as the key abrasive forthe chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of optical glass, advanced integrated circuits and dielectric layers deposited for the fabrication of microelectronic devices. 6\u20138In recent years, with the decrease in size of the integrated circuit architecturedue to chip miniaturization and the increase in precision of theoptical glass planarization due to device upgrade, higherrequirements are put forward for ceria abrasives. 9\u201313 A number of studies have been carried out with respect to the synthesis and tailoring of ceria abrasives, in which the physical and chemical characteristics of ceria particles, such as morphology, size, surface state, have a great in \ue104uence on thepolishing performance.14\u201318Huet al. compared the polishing performance of CeO 2nano-octahedrons and nanospheres on the silicon single crystal substrate and the results showed thatthe CeO 2nano-octahedrons with exposed {111} facets exhibited a stronger material removal capacity and inferior polishingquality than spheres-shaped CeO 2because the nano- octahedron with sharp corners and well-de \ue103ned edges could induce higher compressive stress.19Sreeremya et al. observed a strong morphology dependence of ceria nano-abrasives inglass polishing and the ceria nanostructure with a mixedmorphology of rods and cubes exhibited the highest materialremoval rate and the best surface \ue103nish compared to nano-cube and nanosphere. 20Peng et al. carried out contrast experiments using ceria abrasive with micro and nano particle sizes in glass polishing and found that the material was removed by chemical reaction for ceria nanoparticles, while chemical reaction andmechanical abrasion simultaneously took place for ceria parti-cles with sizes at scale of micrometers. 21 In addition to size and morphology of the particle, the pol- ishing performance of ceria abrasive is also a \ufb00ected by the heat treatment conditions. Janos et al. prepared ceria abrasive by calcining carbonate or oxalate precursors and the calcination temperature was found to be a critical parameter that governed the polishing e \ufb03ciency and the quality of the polished surface.22Kim et al. studied the e \ufb00ect of the oxygen partial pressure on the crystalline structure of ceria particles during theaSchool of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330031, China.

    "calcination of carbonate precursor and the results showed that the calcination process with a high oxygen concentration was bene\ue103cial for the synthesis of cubic phase CeO 2with enhanced shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP performance.23 Although much work has been done on the fabrication of ceria abrasives, there are few studies on the correlations betweencalcination temperature and abrasive morphology, chemicalactivity and mechanical hardness. Herein, using hierarchicalCeO 2octahedrons as precursor, we synthesized a series of octa- hedral ceria abrasives with di \ufb00erent microstructure and surface characteristics by varying calcination temperature. The relation-ship between calcination temperature and microstructure,mechanical hardness and chemical activity was establishedthrough polishing experiments on K9 glass. This work shed a lighton manipulating the mechanical and chemical properties of ceriaabrasives from a microstructural perspective, providing new ideasfor the design and synthesis of ceria polishing materials. Experimental Preparation Hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor with an average edge length of /C24200 nm was synthesized according to our previous report by a hydrothermal method.24Typically, 21.711 g of Ce(NO 3)3$6H2O and 11.117 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) were dissolved in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water. The pH of thesolution was adjusted to 4.0 with 0.1 M NaOH solution. Themixture was transferred into a Te \ue104on-lined stainless autoclave (capacity 500 ml) and heated at 180 /C14C for 24 h. A \ue09der washed and dried in an oven at 60/C14C for 12 h, the hierarchical CeO 2 octahedrons were calcined at 500, 600, 700, 800 or 900/C14C in air for 2 h to obtain polishing abrasive (Sample A \u2013E). Characterization Thermal analysis was performed using a PE PYRIS Diamond TG- DTA in air at a heating rate of 10/C14Cm i n/C01from room tempera- ture to 900/C14C. The phase and composition of the samples were characterized by X-ray powder di \ufb00raction (XRD, Bruker axs D8 Advance) using Cu K aradiation ( l\u00bc0.15406 nm). The morphology and structure were examined by \ue103eld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Quanta-200F micro-scope) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 microscope). Raman spectra were recorded on a RenishawinVia spectrometer using 532 nm laser excitation. The BET (Bru-nauer \u2013Emmett \u2013Teller) surface area of the samples was deter- mined by physical adsorption of N 2at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ gas adsorption analyzer. The surface zeta potential measurement of the samples was performed using an AgilentZetaprobe 7020. The particle size distribution was measured bya Bettersize 2000LD particle size analyzer. X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using a Thermo Scienti \ue103c Escalab 250Xi with Al K aradiation ( hn\u00bc1486.6 eV). Polishing tests The slurry was prepared by dispersing ceria abrasive calcined at di\ufb00erent temperature into DI water under stirring and thentreated by ultrasound for 15 min. The solid content (for abra- sive) of the slurry was 3 wt% and the pH value of the slurry was about 6.7. Polishing tests were performed at the K9 optical glasswafers with a diameter of 60 mm by a UNIPOL-802 CMPequipment (Shenyang Kejing Co. Ltd.). The polishing processparameters were set as follows: using a synthetic leather padwith rotation speed 200 rpm, downforce 0.67 psi, feed rate of theslurry 2 L min /C01, polishing temperature of 25 /C62/C14C, polishing time 1 h. A \ue09der polishing, the wafers were rinsed by absolute ethyl alcohol and DI water and then dried naturally in a super clean room. Material removal rate (MRR) was calculatedaccording the formula MRR \u00bc(m 0/C0m)/rtA, where ris the density of the K9 glass (2.51 g cm/C03),Ais the area of the wafer, t is polishing time, m0is the original mass of the wafer and mis mass of the wafer a \ue09der polishing. The MRR is the average of 3 runs. The surface topography and root mean square (RMS)roughness were measured by atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon). Results and discussion The hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor was self-assembled by spherical primary nanocrystals of about 5 nm which sharedan almost common crystallographic orientation (Fig. S1 \u2020). The thermal behaviour of the precursor was investigated with TG-DTA. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the TG curve exhibited contin-uous weight loss in a broad temperature range from roomtemperature to 500 /C14C. The total weight loss is measured at about 13%. The weight loss before 200/C14C is ascribed to the removal of free water or adsorbed water and the signi \ue103cant weight loss from 200 to 500/C14C is attributed to the combustion of the residual surfactant PVP. The DTA curve showed twoexothermic peaks around 254 and 337 /C14C, corresponding to the exothermic behaviour during the thermal decomposition/oxidation of PVP. Fig. 2 showed the XRD patterns of the calcined products. All the di\ufb00raction peaks can be indexed to the pure cubic \ue104uorite structure of CeO 2with lattice constant of a\u00bc5.41 \u02daA, which is in good agreement with the JCPDS card (no. 34-0394). As thecalcination temperature was increased, the peaks in the XRDpattern became sharper and the full width at half maximum Fig. 1 TG-DTA pattern of the hierarchical octahedral CeO 2precursor. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

    "(FWHM) decreased, indicating better crystallinity and an increase in the grain size with rising calcination temperature. The morphology of the calcined products was examined by SEM. As illustrated in Fig. 3a \u2013e, the samples calcined at di\ufb00erent temperatures have octahedral shape with rounded edges and corners. High-magni \ue103cation SEM images of a single octahedron revealed that they possessed di \ufb00erent surface structures (Fig. 3f \u2013j). The samples calcined at temperature values of 500, 600 and 700/C14C have a hierarchical structure similar to the precursor and small primary particles can be clearly observed on the surface. When the calcination temper- ature increased to 800 and 900/C14C, the surface of the calcined products became smooth, indicating that the primary particleswere fused. More details about the crystallinity and structure of the samples calcined at di \ufb00erent temperatures were studied with TEM, selected area electron di \ufb00raction (SAED) and high- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 4a \u2013c displayed the typical TEM images of a single particle of Sample A \u2013C oriented along the [110] zone axis, showing that they were assembled from small primary particles. The corre-sponding SAED patterns exhibited single-crystal-like electrondi\ufb00raction spots, in which the high-order di \ufb00raction spots were obviously prolonged (Fig. 4f \u2013h). This suggested that the primary particles were assembled into octahedrons with almost thesame crystallographic orientation. As the calcination tempera-ture was increased to 800 /C14C, the primary particles fused signi\ue103cantly and the elongation of high-order di \ufb00raction spots became inconspicuous (Fig. 4d and i). When the calcinationtemperature reached 900 /C14C, CeO 2octahedrons with single crystal structure were obtained (Fig. 4e and j). The HRTEM images (Fig. 4k \u2013o) taken from the white-boxed areas in Fig. 4a \u2013e revealed the evolution of primary particles with the incrementof calcination temperature. The primary nanocrystals changedfrom spherical-like particles of about 5 nm to sharp octahedralparticles with the edge length of about 8 nm as the calcinationtemperature increased from 500 to 700 /C14C. With the calcination temperature rising up to 800/C14C, the primary nanocrystals were fused together to form big particles and the boundary between these big particles was not obvious. As the calcination temper- ature was 900/C14C, the primary nanocrystals were completely fused and the hierarchical structure disappeared, formingsingle crystal CeO 2octahedrons. This is consistent with the XRD results, i.e., the increase in calcination temperature led to the increase of crystallinity and grain size. The Raman spectroscopy technology was also used to investigate the structure of the calcined products. As shown in Fig. 5, the main Raman band was peaked at about 462.5, 462.6, 464.2, 464.7, 465.9 cm/C01for Sample A \u2013E. It belongs to the only allowed Raman mode (F 2g) of cubic- \ue104uorite-structured CeO 2, which is attributed to the symmetrical stretching mode of Ce \u2013 O8vibrational unit.25The F 2gmode is very sensitive to the disorder in oxygen sublattice caused by thermal or grain sizedinduced e \ufb00ects. 26\u201328In bulk CeO 2this frequency is 465 \u2013 466 cm/C01. For the calcined products, we observed a red-shi \ue09dof this main Raman band accompanied by peak broadening as the calcination temperature decreased. This is attributable to thedecrease of grain size revealed by XRD and TEM. The products calcined at di \ufb00erent temperatures were prepared into polishing slurries to investigate their polishing Fig. 2 XRD patterns of the calcined products (Sample A \u2013E).

    "performance on K9 glass. Table 1 showed the physical charac- teristics of the calcined products and their MRR values forpolishing K9 glass. It can be seen that the speci \ue103c surface area decreased with values at 122.80, 113.01 and 75.96 m 2g/C01with the increasing calcination temperature at 500, 600 and 700/C14C, which is consistent with the increase in the size of primary nanocrystals caused by the elevated calcination temperature.Due to the fusion of primary nanocrystals, the speci \ue103c surface area of products calcined at 800 and 900 /C14C decreased sharply to 34.24 and 12.79 m2g/C01. All the calcined products were positively charged with the surface zeta potential of 116.6, 79.2, 77.2, 75.0and 40.2 mV for Sample A \u2013E. A zeta potential value of 30 mV (positive or negative) can be taken as the arbitrary value thatjudges stability of particle dispersion, so the calcined products have good dispersion stability. Considering that K9 glass has anelectronegative surface charge (negative zeta potential), oppo-site surface charge will lead to the adhesion of calcined particlesto the K9 surface by electrostatic attraction, which is helpful to improve the removal rate. 29,30The particle size distribution measurement showed that D90of the calcined products was remarkably increased with the rising of calcination tempera-ture, resulting in the broadening of the particle size distribution(Rvalues). This may be because with the increase of calcination temperature, fusion occurred not only between primary nano-crystals, but also between octahedrons, forming particleagglomerates. The polishing rate of the calcined products towards K9 glass was also shown in Table 1. With calcination temperature rising,MRR \ue103rst increased and then decreased. The products calcined at 700 /C14C was found to possess the highest MRR (187.9 nm min/C01). From the mechanical e \ufb00ect during polishing, the increment of calcination temperature increased the grain sizeand made the octahedrons denser, thereby improving themechanical hardness of the octahedral particles, which could explain the increase in MRR from 140.6 to 187.9 nm min /C01 when the calcination temperature went up from 500 to 700/C14C. However, as the calcination temperature continued to rise to800 and 900 /C14C, we observed a decrease in MRR. This showed that apart from the mechanical friction, the chemical e \ufb00ect during polishing is also important. CeO 2is an excellent polishing material for glass, because it relies not only on mechanical friction but also on chemical Fig. 4 TEM images (a \u2013e) and corresponding SEAD patterns (f \u2013j) of single particle for Sample A \u2013E.

    "reaction with the glass surface to achieve material removal.6,7,31 \u201334From the chemical e \ufb00ect during polishing, Ce \u2013 OH on the CeO 2surface can react with Si \u2013OH on the glass surface to form Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bond that is stronger than Si \u2013O\u2013Si bond, thereby realizing the removal of the glass surface layer. Many studies have shown that the surface Ce oxidation state had a great impact on the polishing performance of CeO 2 particles.15\u201317,35,36It was believed that CeO 2particle with high surface Ce3+concentration was bene \ue103cial to improve thechemical e \ufb00ect during CMP for the reason that Ce3+sites helped the formation of Ce \u2013OH groups at the CeO 2surface in aqueous medium through H 2O dissociation and facilitated the breaking up of Si \u2013O bond during polishing.7\u201310,31 \u201334,37 \u201339Therefore, XPS analysis was carried out to investigate the surface Ce oxidationstate of the calcined products. Fig. 6 showed the Ce 3d spectra ofSample A \u2013E. Quantitative calculation of the Ce 3+concentration was conducted by peak deconvolution of XPS spectra using themixed Gaussian \u2013Lorentzian function. Ten deconvoluted peaks could be observed, of which the peaks labelled as vcorrespond to Ce 3d 5/2at low binding energy and the peaks labelled as u refer to Ce 3d 3/2at high binding energy.40Among the ten peaks, two doublets ( v0,u0), (v1,u1) are indexed to two di \ufb00erent \ue103nal states of Ce3+in CeO 2owing to the emission from the spin \u2013orbit split 3d 5/2and 3d 3/2core levels and three doublets ( v0,u0), (v00, u00), (v000,u000) result from di \ufb00erent \ue103nal states of Ce4+. The concentration of Ce3+ions in Sample A \u2013E was calculated by dividing the area corresponding to Ce3+to the total integrated area of Ce 3d. As displayed in Table 2, with increasing calcina-tion temperature from 500 to 900 /C14C, the Ce3+concentration decreased from 24.2 to 20.5%. Combined with the speci \ue103c surface area data, it can be concluded that the surface chemicalactivity decreased from Sample A to Sample E. Fig. 7 showed the O1s XPS spectra of the calcined products. The peak centered at 529.0 \u2013529.6 eV is ascribed to the charac- teristic peak of lattice oxygen in CeO 2. The position of this peak shi\ue09ded to lower binding energy with increasing calcination temperature, indicating the change in the chemical environ-ment of lattice oxygen in CeO 2. According to the reports in literature,41,42the conversion of Ce3+to Ce4+in CeO 2easily led to the shi \ue09dof oxygen binding energy to a low position.

    "implied that the ratio of Ce4+increased as the calcination temperature rose, which is in accordance with the Ce 3d XPSanalysis. The decline in chemical activity thus resulted in lower MRR for Sample D and E calcined at 800 and 900 /C14C than for Sample C calcined at 700/C14C. Surface quality a \ue09der polishing is also crucial to evaluate the CMP e \ufb00ect. Fig. 8 displayed the surface roughness of the K9 glass wafer before and a \ue09der polished with the calcined prod- ucts. Results showed that the RMS surface roughness of K9glass in a 20 mm/C220mm area a \ue09der CMP by Sample A \u2013E was 1.66/C60.131, 0.893 /C60.058, 0.793 /C60.066, 0.877 /C60.072 and 0.951 /C60.065 nm, respectively. Sample C calcinated at 700 /C14C exhibited the best surface quality a \ue09der polishing. The K9 surface polished by Sample A has a high surface roughnessalthough the particle size distribution of this sample is narrow,which should be ascribed to the mismatch between chemicalactivity and mechanical hardness of the particles. The RMSroughness of K9 glass polished by Sample D and E alsoincreased compared to Sample C. In addition to the mismatch between chemical activity and mechanical hardness of the particles, this may be also related to the broadening of particlessize distribution. Although all the calcined products have the quasi-octahedral shape with a similar edge length of 200 nm, their microstruc-ture and physicochemical properties changed due to thedi\ufb00erent calcination temperatures, leading to varied polishing e\ufb00ects. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the octahedral CeO 2in water is terminated with Ce \u2013OH 2+due to the positive zeta potential while the surface of the K9 wafer is Si \u2013O/C0.43The opposite surface charge between K9 surface and the calcined octahe-drons leads to a strong electrostatic attraction. Under certain pressure, Ce \u2013OH 2+on the surface of octahedrons will react with Si\u2013O/C0to form Ce \u2013O\u2013Si bonds, thus weakening the Si \u2013O\u2013Si bonds on K9 surface layer. This surface layer activated bychemical reaction is then removed by mechanical friction ofoctahedrons. The removal of K9 surface layer is achieved underthe synergy of chemical reaction and mechanical friction. Whenthe calcination temperature is low, the chemical e \ufb00ect of the octahedral particles is stronger than their mechanical e \ufb00ect during polishing, resulting in low MRR and high surface roughness. At a high calcination temperature, such as 900 /C14C, the chemical e \ufb00ect is weak and the mechanical e \ufb00ect domi- nates, which also brings about a decrease in MRR and anincrease in RMS. The octahedral CeO 2obtained at a calcination temperature of 700/C14C has the best matching chemical and mechanical e \ufb00ects, resulting in high MRR and low surface roughness. Conclusions Octahedral CeO 2particles with di \ufb00erent microstructures were obtained by calcining the hierarchical CeO 2octahedrons at Fig. 7 O1s XPS spectra of the calcined products (Sample A \u2013E).

    "varied temperatures. The di \ufb00erence in microstructure makes these octahedral CeO 2particles have varied physicochemical properties, resulting in di \ufb00erent polishing e \ufb00ects on K9 glass. At low calcination temperatures of 500 and 600/C14C, the octa- hedral particles maintained the hierarchical structure of theprecursor, which possessed high chemical activity and lowmechanical hardness. The primary nanoparticles were fusedtogether and single crystal CeO 2octahedrons were formed at high calcination temperatures of 800 and 900/C14C, which had better mechanical hardness but lower chemical activity. The octahedral particles calcined at 700/C14C had the best matching of chemical activity and mechanical hardness, thus exhibiting thebest polishing performance toward K9 glass.

Abstract: Ceria-based abrasives are widely used in precision chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) \ufb01elds, such as thin \ufb01lm transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) glass substrates and integrated circuits, because of their excellent physicochemical properties. Rare earth carbonates, as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, directly affect the morphology of ceria-based abrasives, which, in turn, affects the material removal rate (MRR) and the surface roughness (R a) after polishing. Herein, rare earth carbonates with different morphologies were obtained by adjusting reaction parameters during precipitation, including \ufb02ake, spindle, and spheroid. Moreover, the phase of precursors was analyzed, and the evolution process of morphology from precursors to ceria-based abrasives was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was explored. The results show that the primary particles of ceria-based abrasives are near-spherical, but the morphology and dispersion of the secondary particles are obviously inherited from precursors. Among them, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives prepared by nearly monodisperse near-spherical precursors show better uniformity and higher dispersion, and they not only achieve the lowest R abut also obtain a higher MRR of 555 nm/min (9 wt.%) for polishing TFT-LCD glass substrates. The result is signi\ufb01cant for the further optimization and application of high-performance ceria-based abrasives.

Introduction Ceria-based abrasives are an important CMP-polishing material, which are widely used in polishing glass, the substrate of materials devices, and other silica-containing materials, due to its uniform particle size, moderate hardness, high polishing ef\ufb01ciency, and excellent polishing quality [ 1\u20136]. It has been paid attention to glass substrate polishing because of its greater application prospects. The TFT-LCD glass substrates are used in the thin \ufb01lm transistor liquid crystal display, which is a key strategic material in the electronic information display industry. Their surface machining accuracy is directly related to the display panel\u2019s resolution, transmittance, and other key performance indicators [ 7,8]. The TFT-LCD glass substrates are divided by the area in the display industry, and it is generally considered that the 6th generation line and below is the low generation, and the 8.5 generation line (2200 mm \u00022500 mm) and above is the high generation. The high generation conforms to the development trend of the future large-screen and multi-screen era, and market demand is increasing. The high-generation TFT-LCD glass substrate is thin and soft, so the polishing accuracy is extremely strict. A single piece of high-generation glass substrate has an area of more than 5.5 m2and a thickness of only a few hundred micrometers. The polished glass substrate is required to have high \ufb02atness and smoothness. Materials 2022 ,15, 7525. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15217525 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials",
    "Materials 2022 ,15, 7525 2 of 11 Furthermore, the requirements for the performance of ceria-based abrasives are getting more stringent, including a higher MRR and an extremely low R a[9]. Ceria-based abrasives and polished substrates polished exhibit chemical and mechanical interactions in the CMP process, and mechanical interactions play a dominant role [ 10\u201312]. The morphology of abrasives is a very important factor in the CMP process. It can signi\ufb01cantly affect the polishing performance and CMP-induced defects, such as erosion and dishing [ 13]. Therefore, the morphology of ceria-based abrasives needs to be further optimized because of its signi\ufb01cant impact on polishing performance. Currently, the commonly used preparation method of ceria-based abrasives mainly includes three processes, which are precipitation, \ufb02uorination, and calcination [ 14\u201316]. However, high-precision classi\ufb01cation is adopted to reasonably control the size of ceria- based abrasives [ 17,18]. The morphology and structure of ceria-based abrasives determine their polishing performance, so the in\ufb02uence of different process parameters on ceria- based abrasives has been studied extensively [ 19]. The \ufb02uorination can improve the dispersity of particles and the ceria-based abrasives\u2019 MRR for the glass by introducing the \ufb02uridizer [ 20,21]. The \ufb02uorine (F) atoms can signi\ufb01cantly improve the chemical activity of ceria in the polishing process, as well as enhance its polishing performance, and it can form LaOF and LaF 3. However, LaF 3with low hardness is easily crushed during polishing, which lowers the MRR and shortens the useful life of ceria-based abrasives. Hydro\ufb02uoric acid (HF) is widely used as a \ufb02uridizer because of its better reaction rate and reaction uniformity, but excessive addition can damage the polished glass surface and increase the R a[22]. In addition, calcination directly impacts phase structures and surface properties of ceria-based abrasives [ 19,23,24]. It was found for the ceria-based abrasives that the MRR increases with the calcination temperature. In the temperature range of ca.300\u2013700\u000eC,not only do the physical characteristics of ceria-based abrasives change dramatically, but so do their chemical activities [ 25,26]. However, there are still relatively few studies that demonstrate clear relationships of precursors, ceria-based abrasives, and polishing performance. Rare earth carbonates are precipitation precursors, which are widely used in the industrial production of ceria-based abrasives. Previous research has shown that there are many types of rare earth carbonates, including rare-earth carbonates (RE 2(CO 3)3) [27], hydroxycarbonates (REOHCO 3) [28], oxycarbonate hydrates (RE 2O(CO 3)2\u0001H2O), and di- oxycarbonates (RE 2O2CO 3) (where RE represents a rare-earth ion) [ 29\u201331], which have been studied extensively at the nano- and micro-scale. In addition, rare earth carbonates with a broad range of morphologies can be obtained by different synthetic methods and experimental conditions, including spherical particles, triangular microplates, nanorods, nanoplates, etc. [ 32]. The urea homogenous precipitation method was the \ufb01rst technique employed to synthesize monodispersed spherical particles of rare earth carbonates [ 33]. Nanorods and nanoplates of rare earth carbonates can be obtained by altering counter anions [ 34]. Rare earth carbonates as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, their phase structures, and morphologies directly affect the physicochemical characteristics of abrasives and further affect their polishing rate and polishing precision. However, ordinary ceria- based abrasives are commonly prepared by \ufb02ake-like rare earth carbonates in industrial production, which is the main reason for the low polishing accuracy. Here, this work focus on the effects of rare earth carbonates on the morphology and chemical mechanical polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives. Rare earth carbonates with different phase structures and morphologies were synthesized by altering conditions during precipitation, where ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4HCO 3) and lanthanum-cerium sulfate mixed liquid ((Ce 0.7, La 0.3)2(SO 4)3\u0001xH2O) were used as raw materials, and La was added to improve the polishing performance of abrasives [ 35,36]. Then, ceria-based abrasives were obtained by \ufb02uorating and calcinating rare earth carbonates with different shapes, and the effect of precursors on the morphology of ceria-based abrasives was studied. Furthermore, the CMP process of ceria-based abrasives prepared by different precursors",

Polishing Measurements The polishing process of ceria-based abrasives for TFT-LCD glass substrates was performed by a high-precision laboratory polishing machine (ProLap-15). Ceria-based abrasives were applied in the form of an abrasives slurry with different mass percentages. For each experiment, TFT-LCD glass substrates with a thickness of 0.5 mm were cut to 20 mm \u000225 mm as polishing samples, and they adhered to a ceramic disc for polishing. The polishing test was performed with a pressure of 95 kPa and a time of 10 min. The velocity of the polishing pad was 45 rpm, and the \ufb02ow velocity of the abrasives slurry was 50 mL/min. After polishing, polishing samples were removed from the ceramic disc by heating, rinsed with alcohol, and dried for further testing. The MRR of TFT-LCD glass substrates was determined via gravimetry from the mass loss during the polishing experiment, and the results were expressed in terms of the linear removal rate of TFT-LCD glass substrates in nm/min. In addition, scratches were observed and recorded on the surface of TFT-LCD glass substrates by a white light interferometer. 2.4. Characterization The size and morphology of ceria-based abrasives were observed with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SEM, JEOL, Akishima, Japan, JSM-7900F). The phase analysis of ceria-based abrasives was achieved by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Smart-lab, Tokyo, Japan, 9KW) equipped with Cu-K radiation.

Figure 3 shows the presence of amorphous phases for the N-precursors and F-precursors because of the low precipitation temperature, and it can be solved by calcination. Extensive literature indicates that different factors have effects on the phase and morphology of rare-earth carbonate particles. The reaction temperature is a parameter that allows easy control over the size and shape of rare earth carbonate particles [ 33]. In this work, the escape rate of carbon dioxide from rare earth carbonates was accelerated to a certain extent by increasing the reaction temperature and (Ce, La) 2O(CO 3)2\u0001xH2O were formed [ 23]. The phase structures of precursors with different morphologies are different. XRD results show that F-precursors have the stronger <200> crystal plane and the un-conspicuous <101> crystal plane than N-precursors. According to crystal growth theory, the shape of the crystal depends on the relative growth rate of each crystal face. In this work, it shows that the morphology of precursors is affected by the relative growth rate of each crystal face [ 37,38], and the crystal plane of F-precursors and N-precursors with identical phases grow differently, so the morphology of precursors is different.

Figure 4 shows SEM images of ceria -based abrasives, which are flake -like (F -abrasives), spindle -like (S -abrasives), and near -spherical (N-abrasives), respectively. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the morphology and the dis- persity of secondary particles about ceria -based abrasives are inherited from their precur- sors. Howeve r, the morphology of primary particles is almost near -spherical because of the etching of the HF solution. Moreover, primary particles\u2019 sizes are close, and the aver- age size is ~50 nm. This result may be attributed to the consistent conditions in the fluor i- nation, such as the concentration and the additive amount of HF solution. Among them, the size of N -abrasives does not change obviously , compared with their precursors. The reason is that the particle size of near -spherical precursors is small (~50 nm) an d close to the primary particle size of abrasives, and it is difficult to etch into smaller particles on the original basis during fluorination.

As shown in Figure 6a, unclassified F -abrasives and N -abrasives have the largest and smallest size, respectively. Among them, the size distribution of S -abrasives with double p eaks corresponds to their morphology. F -abrasives and S -abrasives have large particles after calcination, so they need to be further classified before the CMP. In this study, airflow classification is used to classify calcined products. The overall particl e size distribution of graded F -abrasives and S -abrasives particles was consistent with that of ungraded N -abrasives particles (Figure 6b). The three kinds of abrasives have the same particle size distribution by adjusting airflow classification parameters . Further, the abra- sives slurry with different concentrations was prepared. The polishing performance of ceria -based abrasives for TFT -LCD glass substrates was further evaluated. Figure 6. Particle size distributions of unclassified ( a) and classified ( b) ceria -based abrasives. Figure 7a shows the R a of TFT -LCD glass substrates polished by the ceria -based abra- sives slurry with different concentrations. In this study, the average height difference within a certain area (0.86 mm \u00d7 0.86 mm) was calculated as the R a. It can be seen from Figure 7a that N -abrasives always achieve a lower R a than those of F -abrasives and S - abrasives in the concentration range of 1\u20139 wt.%. The R a of F-abrasives and S -abrasives are more than 1.5 nm, but the R a of N -abrasives is les s than 1 nm at the appropriate con- centration. Therefore, N -abrasives\u2019 polishing quality is better because of their higher dis- persion and homogeneity. Figure 7b shows the MRR of ceria -based abrasives with differ- ent morphologies. It can be seen that the MRR of three kinds of ceria -based abrasives in- creases with the increase in the slurry concentration. The MRR of F -abrasives is higher, and the MRR of N -abrasives is lower at the same concentration than F -abrasives. The shape of F -abrasives is irregular and ang ular, so the MRR is higher. By contrast, the mor- phology and size of N -abrasives are more uniform, so the MRR of N -abrasives is lower than F -abrasives at the same concentration. Their MRR increases with the increase in the concentration over a certain range , and the value of MRR reaches to 555 nm/min when the concentration is 9 wt.%. However, the MRR of F -abrasives and S -abrasives decreases with the increase in concentration from 7 wt.% to 9 wt.%. The main reason is that a higher concentration is easy to cau se particle accumulation on the glass surface under experi- mental conditions, reducing the effective contact area [39,40 ]. Additionally, when the abrasives slurry concentration is high, the particle size after agglomeration is larger. Be- cause the polishing pad is in direct contact with the raised parts of the TFT -LCD glass substrates, not all particles play a role (Figure 8). In addition, the polishing pad will pro- duce recesses, and a number of small particles will be trapped under polishing pressure. The larger the function ing particles, the deeper the recesses will happen, and the small Figure 6. Particle size distributions of unclassi\ufb01ed ( a) and classi\ufb01ed ( b) ceria-based abrasives. Figure 7a shows the R aof TFT-LCD glass substrates polished by the ceria-based abrasives slurry with different concentrations. In this study, the average height differ- ence within a certain area (0.86 mm \u00020.86 mm) was calculated as the R a. It can be seen from Figure 7a that N-abrasives always achieve a lower R athan those of F-abrasives and S-abrasives in the concentration range of 1\u20139 wt.%. The R aof F-abrasives and S-abrasives are more than 1.5 nm, but the R aof N-abrasives is less than 1 nm at the appropriate concentration. Therefore, N-abrasives\u2019 polishing quality is better because of their higher dispersion and homogeneity. Figure 7b shows the MRR of ceria-based abra- sives with different morphologies. It can be seen that the MRR of three kinds of ceria-based abrasives increases with the increase in the slurry concentration. The MRR of F-abrasives is higher, and the MRR of N-abrasives is lower at the same concentration than F-abrasives. The shape of F-abrasives is irregular and angular, so the MRR is higher.

The main reason is that a higher con- centration is easy to cause particle accumulation on the glass surface under experimental conditions, reducing the effective contact area [ 39,40]. Additionally, when the abrasives slurry concentration is high, the particle size after agglomeration is larger. Because the polishing pad is in direct contact with the raised parts of the TFT-LCD glass substrates, not all particles play a role (Figure 8). In addition, the polishing pad will produce recesses, and a number of small particles will be trapped under polishing pressure. The larger the functioning particles, the deeper the recesses will happen, and the small particles will be trapped and make no sense [ 41,42]. On the contrary, the proportion of functioned particles to all the particles in the slurry will increase due to the better uniformity and dispersity of abrasives slurry with lower concentration. Thus, high concentrations do not consistently increase the MRR for F-abrasives and S-abrasives, and the MRR of N-abrasives increases with the increase in the slurry concentration.",

Conclusions Precipitation precursors with different morphologies and phases were obtained by altering the reaction conditions in the precipitation. The effect of precursors on the mor- phology of ceria -based abrasives was explored. The result shows that the morphology and dispersity of secondary particles inherit their precursors, and primary particles of abra- sives are almost near -spherical with a size of ~50 nm because of the etching of HF solution. Therefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more condu- cive to obtaining high uniformity ceria -based abrasives. Furthermore, the effect of precursors on the CMP performance of ceria -based abra- sives was explored. High -performance ceria -based abrasives need to achieve a high MRR and good polishing quality (a low R a) at the same time. Although F -abrasives have a higher MRR ( \u02c3500 nm/min ), more scratches (R a \u02c3 2 nm) are caused by their irregular mor- phology. By contrast, near -spherical ceria -based abrasives are beneficial to improving the polishing contact area and reducing mechanical damage. N -abrasives obtained by N -pre- cursors have the characte ristics of uniform morphology, narrow size, and high dispersion, which not only achieve s a high MRR (9 wt.%, 555 nm/min) but also reach es excellent pol- ishing quality to TFT -LCD glass substrates, including the lower R a (\u02c21.5 nm) and fewer scratches. Therefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more conducive to obtaining high -performance ceria -based abrasives. N -abrasives have great application potential for the precision polishing of TFT -LCD glass substrates.

Ceria powders were synthesized by calcination at temperatures of 400, 600, 700, 800, and 900/C14C. The in\ufb02uence of the calcination temperature on the physical characteristics, such as the crystallinity, grain size, porosity, morphology and high-resolution lattice images of the ceria particles, wereinvestigated, and a correlation between the physical characteristics and the electrokinetic behaviors of the ceria particles in aqueous suspending media was also investigated to identify the relationship with CMP performance. Grain size increased with calcination temperature, as did the removal rate of plasma-enhanced tetraethylorthosilicate (PETEOS) \ufb01lm with slurriesincluding these particles. The results indicate that the grain size of ceria particles is one of the key parameters controlling the removal rate and uniformity of PETEOS \ufb01lm.

Introduction The shallow trench isolation (STI) method has replaced the local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) method because ofits excellent ability to decrease isolation width, leading toimproved device density. 1)Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is applied as a key process in the STI method. Compared with other abrasive materials used in polishingslurry for STI CMP, cerium oxide or ceria (CeO 2)i s commonly used in ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI)processes because it provides high removal rates, due to itschemical reactivity with silica substrates, and a high removalselectivity between oxide and nitride \ufb01lms. 2,3)The reaction between cerium oxide and glass/SiO 2\ufb01lm results in the formation of a chemical \u2018\u2018tooth\u2019\u2019 between the silica surface and the ceria particles, inducing a localized strain in theglass with particle movement. 4)Consequently, the Si\u2013O\u2013Ce bonds can be rapidly removed by the mechanical forcegenerated by the pressed pad and the abrasive particles, andphysical properties, such as good crystallinity, lead to a highremoval rate for glass/SiO 2\ufb01lm. The physical properties of ceria particles in slurry can signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ect the oxide \ufb01lm removal rate and the presence of CMP-induced defects, such as micro-scratchesor dishing, in the STI CMP process. 5,6)Recently, research- ers7\u20139)have shown interest in the physical aspects as well as the chemical aspects, of the CMP mechanism. The physicalproperties of ceria particles, such as the crystallinity, particleroughness, and morphology, depend on the synthesismethod. 9)Several methods of preparing cerium oxide have been reported in the literature: the solid-state displacement technique,10,11)wet precipitation,12)sol\u2013gel technology,13) the hydrothermal technique,14)electrochemical synthesis,15) the inert gas condensation technique,16)mechanochemical synthesis,17)and the \ufb02ux method.18)The key parameter of the physical properties a\ufb00ecting STI CMP performance,however, has not speci\ufb01cally been addressed yet. Addition-ally, the physical properties of the ceria particles a\ufb00ect the electrokinetic behavior of CeO 2particles in an aqueousmedium. The electrokinetic behavior of the abrasive particles is an essential factor in the improved performanceof the slurry, since it is in\ufb02uenced by di\ufb00erences in thesurface potentials of ceria abrasives and oxide plasma-enhanced tetraethylorthosilicate (PETEOS) and CVD Si 3N4 \ufb01lms.2) In this study, ceria particles were prepared by the solid- state decomposition method, as the particles synthesized bythis technique have a higher removal rate for glass/SiO 2\ufb01lm than any of the other synthesis methods.9)Additionally, with this process it is simpler and more convenient to control thephysical properties of ceria. We investigated the physicalproperties of ceria particles by controlling the calcinationtemperature in the solid-state decomposition method and examining the resulting CMP performance, including the PETEOS removal rate in the STI CMP process. We haveattempted to correlate the physical properties of ceriaparticles, as controlled by the calcination temperature, withthe CMP performance. 2. Experimental Ceria powders were synthesized by the solid-state decomposition method in this study. This method employs high-purity cerium carbonate [Ce(CO 3)3, reagent grade, United International, Inc., Germany] as a starting material.The ceria powders were synthesized by calcination under anair atmosphere at various temperatures (400, 600, 700, 800,and 900 /C14C) for 4 h, resulting in the formation of ceria powder. The mechanical milling of ceria powder was carriedout with a basket-type Mixer/Mill (Ring Mill, Dae Yang, Inc., Korea) using zirconia balls (0.8 mm diameter). The prepared powders were then characterized by various methods. The decomposition behavior of the calcinedprecursor was monitored by simultaneous (TG and DTA)thermal analyses (SDT 2960, TA Instruments) up to 900 /C14C at a heating rate of 10/C14C/min in synthetic air ( /C2420%, O 2), and using alumina (Alumalox, Alcoa) as a referencematerial. The crystal structure was analyzed with a di\ufb00rac- tometer (RINT/DMAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan) using Cu-K /C11 radiation ( /C21\u00bc0:1542 nm) at a scan rate of 2 /C14min/C01 (2/C18min/C01). The intensity was logged over a 2/C18range of/C3E-mail address: upaik@hanyang.ac.krJapanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 43, No. 11A, 2004, pp. 7427\u20137433#2004 The Japan Society of Applied Physics 7427",
    "25\u201360/C14with a scan step of 0.02/C14. The grain sizes of the calcined powders were estimated using an X-ray line broadening method, by applying the Debye\u2013Scherrer equa- tion.19)The powder morphology was observed by trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2010, JEOL,Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. After analyzing the prepared powders, they were dis- persed in deionized water. Drops of the resulting suspen-sions were put on a microscopic grid previously coveredwith a polymer and carbon \ufb01lm. Nitrogen adsorption/ desorption on the powder surface (Micromeritics, ASAP 2010) was used to measure speci\ufb01c surface area (m 2/g) and the pore volume (g/cm) by applying the BET method. Toremove eventual physisorbed species from the powdersurface, the samples were outgassed at 250 /C14C for 2 h prior to each analysis. The surface characteristics were determinedfrom a nitrogen adsorption isotherm measured at 77 K with aconventional volumetric apparatus. For the measurement of electrokinetic behavior of ceria suspension, the ceria particles were \ufb01rst dispersed indeionized water. A total of 220 ml of suspension for eachpowder was prepared at a weight fraction of 1%. Eachsuspension was subjected twice to ultrasonic treatment for15 min in order to break down agglomerates and promotemixing. An ice bath was used to control the temperature ofthe suspension during the ultrasonic treatment. To establish an equilibrium dispersion system, the suspension was aged for 12 h at room temperature using a wrist-action shaker.Following aging, the suspension was ultrasonicated for anadditional 15 min. The electrokinetic behavior of ceriasuspensions was characterized using the electrokinetic sonicamplitude technique (ESA-9800, Matec Applied Sci., Hop-kinton, MA, U.S.A.). In ESA tests, two identical suspensionswere prepared for each analysis. Separate acid (1.0 N HCl) and base (1.0 N KOH) titrations were performed, beginning at the natural pH, and subsequently combined to generate acomplete titration curve. Based on the analysis of prelimi-nary measurement, the standard uncertainty yields /C60:1 mPa/C1m/C1V /C01for ESA measurements and /C60:05(pH units) for pH and IEP values, respectively. Details of this electro-acoustic technique, its application to ceramic systems, andthe estimated measurement precision, have been given in our previous papers. 20,21) The CMP test was carried out using \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent types of slurries with di\ufb00erent calcination temperatures (400, 600,700, 800, and 900 /C14C). The ceria abrasives were dispersed in deionized water and stabilized by adding 100 ppm of acommercially available dispersant (Poly(methacylic acid),M.W. \u00bc10000 ). We also added an anionic organic surfac- tant (Polyacrylic acid, M.W. \u00bc50000 ) at weight fractions (based on solution content) of 0.5% in this experiment. Each slurry was diluted with deionized water to produce a \ufb01nalceria abrasive concentration of 1 wt%. Each suspension pHwas adjusted to the range of 7.0\u20138.0 by adding an alkalineagent. In CMP evaluation, a 200 mm wafer CMP tool (6EC,Strasbaugh, USA) was used. Oxide \ufb01lm was deposited bythe plasma-enhanced tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (PETEOS)method. The thickness of the as-deposited oxide \ufb01lm was 7000 /C23A. A CMP tool for 200 mm wafers (6EC, Strasbaugh, USA) was used and ex-situ conditioning with a diamond dresser was carried out before CMP. The polishing pad wasa grooved IC1000/Suba IV pad (Rodel, USA). The \ufb01lm thickness was measured with a Nanospec 180 (Nano-metrics, USA) in order to determine the removal rate. AfterCMP, the wafers were cleaned with an APM solution (NH 4OH : H 2O2:H2O\u00bc1:1:1 0 )a t8 0/C14C to eliminate residual particles. The polishing test conditions are listed inTable I. 3. Results and Discussion The thermal analysis results of the cerium carbonate precursor synthesized in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Thetotal weight loss was approximately 40%. This result was indicative of the representative thermal decomposition behavior of the normal carbonates. 22)The decomposition of the cerium carbonate precursor had three distinct steps. The\ufb01rst step, mainly occurring at temperatures up to /C24135 /C14C, is due to the evaporation of the absorbed moisture and therelease of molecular water. The second step, occurring in therange /C24135{245 /C14C, is due to the carbonate decomposition with oxycarbonate intermediates. Complete decomposition is almost achieved at 300\u2013400/C14C, noting the oxidation of Ce3\u00feto Ce4\u00feduring heating. The di\ufb00erential thermal analysis curve shows two exothermic peaks. As mentionedabove, the \ufb01rst peak is due to the evaporation of the absorbedmoisture and the release of molecular water. The secondbroad exotherm is due to the carbonate decomposition withthe evolution of CO and CO 2, and assigned to crystallization. Similar results were found by other researchers.22,23)There- fore, we can conclude that the carbonate was fully decom- posed for all types of abrasive prepared in this study at acalcination temperature above 400 /C14C.Table I.

    "Figure 2 shows the X-ray di\ufb00raction (XRD) patterns of the powders calcined at di\ufb00erent temperatures. Broadintensity peaks were observed for the ceria powders whichwere synthesized at 400 /C14C. This result may be considered by the low crystallinity with unreacted carbonate. Although theoxidation of Ce 3\u00feto Ce4\u00feat/C24400/C14C is achieved, the grain size of cerium oxide, which was calcined at this temperature, was very small. This result is due to the small grains andunreacted carbonate, presented in the inner part of thecerium oxide. At the calcination temperature of 400 /C14C, the oxidation of the cerium carbonate is not complete. Thus thiscerium oxide is composed of cerium oxide on the surfaceand unreacted carbonate in the inner part of the particle. Thedi\ufb00raction pattern only shows the peaks of cerium oxide with a \ufb02uorite structure; those for other compounds, such as cerium carbonate and cerous oxide, were not detected.However, the cerium oxide, which was synthesized at400 /C14C, showed a broad intensity peak pro\ufb01le. With increasing calcination temperature, the characteristic peaksof CeO 2became sharper,24)because the grains of single crystals were proportionally grown by heat treatment. Thisresult a\ufb00ected the average grain size of the particles. Thegrain size of CeO 2was investigated to clarify the relation- ship between the calcination temperature and the physical characteristics of the particles. The line-broadening analysisof the (111) peak in XRD was analyzed to con\ufb01rm the grainsize of particles, as will be discussed later. We con\ufb01rmedthat CeO 2abrasive with a good crystallinity was synthesized after calcination at 900/C14C. Figure 3 shows the TEM images and di\ufb00raction patterns of the particles calcined at various temperatures (400, 700, and 900/C14C). These \ufb01gures show that the grain size increased with calcination temperature, and that the morphology of theceria particles varied according to the calcination temper- 28.52relative intensity (a)400\u00b0C(b)600\u00b0C(c)700\u00b0C(d)800\u00b0C(e)900\u00b0C 2\u03b8 / Deg25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Relative intensity 2\u03b8 / Deg Fig. 2.

    "ature. The particles calcined at 400/C14C [Fig. 3(a)] showed a relatively low crystallinity, whereas those calcined at 700/C14C [Fig. 3(b)] and 900/C14C [Fig. 3(c)] exhibited a relatively high crystallinity and the shapes of the grain are well-de\ufb01ned,though some grains seem to contain subgrain boundariesinside. The ring-shaped di\ufb00raction shown in Fig. 3(a) showsthat the particles calcined at temperatures as low as 400 /C14C still maintain their crystal structure. This result coincideswith the XRD peaks shown in Fig. 2(a). The di\ufb00erencebetween the di\ufb00raction patterns of Figs. 3(b) and 2(c) is attributed to the number of grains in the objective aperture, or grain size. To investigate directly the atomic structure andcrystallinity of the ceria particle in detail, 25)a high\u2013 resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image and its two-dimensionalFourier-transformed image were obtained. The lattice imageof the ceria particle calcined at 400 /C14C [Fig. 4(a)] clearly shows that the atomic structure of the particle has a ratherlong-range-ordering (LRO) at least longer than 5 nm. So we can conclude that it is not amorphous but \ufb01ne polycrystal- line. A number of dislocations and orientational domainstructures are also shown. Figure 4(b) is the two-dimen-sional Fourier-transformed image of Fig. 4(a). The ring-like pattern shown in Fig. 4(b) corresponds to the \ufb01ne poly- crystalline structure with various orientations shown in Fig. 4(a). Figure 5 shows the lattice image of the ceriaparticle calcined at 700 /C14C (a) and its Fourier-transformed image (b). The lattice image [Fig. 5(a)] shows the particlehas a highly crystalline structure, though a few dislocationsand stacking-faults were observed, which is also con\ufb01rmedfrom Fig. 5(b). The results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 coincidewell with those in Figs. 2 and 3. The crystallinity of the ceria particles fabricated at various calcination temperatures was also studied. The grain sizes ofthe particles were estimated using the Debye\u2013Scherrerequation 26)by utilizing XRD line broadening as D\u00bc0:9/C21=\u00f0/C12cos/C18\u00de; where /C21is the wavelength of the monochromatic X-ray beam, /C18is the di\ufb00raction angle, and /C12is the half-width of an intensity peak. The intensity peak at 2/C18\u00bc48/C14was chosen for calculating the grain size, since it was clearer than anyother peak and isolated from the others.

    "the grain size moderately increased overall from 14.52 to 38.69 nm as the calcination temperature was increased from400 to 900 /C14C, and it rapidly increased from 700 to 800/C14C, which can be attributed to thermally promoted grain growth27,28)during the calcination process. These results are in agreement with the trend of increasing grain size inthe TEM images shown in Fig. 3. The change in the speci\ufb01c surface area of the samples, measured by the BET method, 29)is also shown in Fig. 6. The particle calcined at 400/C14C had the highest surface area of 137 m2/g. With increasing calcination temperature, the surface area continued to decrease and \ufb01nally reached a value of 1.81 m2/g at 900/C14C. The temperature dependence of the surface area is well correlated with the grain size, i.e.,smaller grains have larger speci\ufb01c surface areas. 27)The particle size was calculated from the speci\ufb01c surface area byassuming that all powders were spherical without intra- orinter-pores, and that the densities of all the calcined powderswere identical to that of pure cerium oxide (7.215 g/cm 3). The calculated values are listed in Table II. There was little di\ufb00erence between the calculated and measured grain sizesin the cases of the particles calcined at 400 and 700 /C14C. On the other hand, there was a considerable di\ufb00erence betweenthe two methods in the case of the particles calcined at900 /C14C, due to the occurrence of aggregation25)of the particles at this temperature. The total pore volume versus calcination temperature curve is shown in Fig. 7. Generally, pores exist in the particles as defects, which result from the decrease in theremoval rate of PETEOS \ufb01lm. This is because such pores arethe cause of decreased particle density, resulting in the reduction of mechanical force between the abrasive and the\ufb01lm. The pore volume markedly decreased between thecalcinations temperatures of 400 /C14C and 600/C14C. As men- tioned above, the particle calcined at 400/C14C is not a dense particle. Consequently many pores exist in the inner part ofthe particle. As the calcination temperature increases, the pore volume decreases with grain growth. The reduction in pore volume is saturated between the calcination temper-atures of 800 /C14C and 900/C14C. The surface potential of the CeO 2particles was measured as a function of pH by the ESA (electrokinetic sonicamplitude) technique. The electrokinetic behavior of theceria suspensions is shown in Fig. 8. The electrophoreticmobility strongly depends on the suspension pH and the surface characteristics of the particle. Di\ufb00erent electro- kinetic behaviors were observed for the ceria powderscalcined at 400 /C14C. The isoelectric pH (pH iep) of the particle calcined at 400/C14C is 5.5, but the pH iepof CeO 2particles calcined at 600 and 900/C14C is 7.5. This di\ufb00erence is due to the partial oxidation of the particle at the calcinationstemperature of 400 /C14C, resulting in di\ufb00erent surface charac- teristics. The results of the CMP \ufb01eld evaluation are shown in Fig. 9.

    "the PETEOS \ufb01lm, rising from 907 /C23A/min at 400/C14Ct o 1471 /C23A/min at 700/C14C. Above 700/C14C, the PETEOS removal rate rapidly increased to 2871 /C23A/min at 900/C14C. On the other hand, the removal rate for CVD Si 3N4\ufb01lm remainde at 40/C23A/min at 400/C14C and 49 /C23A/min at 900/C14C, and did not vary much with calcinations temperature. Thus the oxide-to-nitride selectivity increases with calcination temperature,from 23 at 400 /C14C to 59 at 900/C14C. The polishing of PETEOS is mainly a\ufb00ected by its chemical interaction with the CeO 2 particles, and by physical factors, including the physicalproperties of the particles, the mechanical grinding factor,and so forth. The surface of PETEOS \ufb01lm is soluble in alkaline pH solutions due to the dissolution of Si ions. Interactionbetween the \ufb01lm surface and the ceria particles occursduring the polishing of the PETEOS \ufb01lm, and Si\u2013O\u2013Cebonds are then formed on the \ufb01lm surface. The Si\u2013O\u2013Ce bonding has been reported to be the dominant mechanism in the chemical interaction between PETEOS \ufb01lm and ceriaparticles. 4)The pH was maintained constant for all slurries in this experiment; thus, it can be asserted that the increase inthe removal rate of PETEOS with the calcination temper-ature is related to the physical factors rather than to thechemical interaction. These physical factors are impacted byseveral aspects of the STI CMP process, such as the CMP conditions, abrasive particle morphology, particle size and distribution, and grain size. As seen from Fig. 3, the abrasiveparticles calcined at 400 /C14C had di\ufb00erent morphologies as compared with the other particles. The removal rate can besigni\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ected by mean particle size and agglomer-ated particle size, because frictional force is directly propor-tional to contact area. 30)The morphology of the particles calcined at 400/C14C and the slight increase in particle size above a calcination temperature of 700/C14C cannot account for the continued increase in removal rate with calcinationtemperature. Instead, as shown in Fig. 6, the grain sizeincreased with calcination temperature, which resulted in theincrease in the removal rate of PETEOS \ufb01lm. On the otherhand, the surface of the Si 3N4\ufb01lm during polishing is thought to be passivated with adsorptive surfactant in theslurry, which prevents the abrasive from directly contacting the \ufb01lm surface. 8,31,32)Hence, the removal rates for Si 3N4 \ufb01lm did not vary much regardless of grain size increasing with calcination temperature.4. Conclusions We prepared abrasive ceria particles by controlling the calcination temperature (in the solid-state decompositionmethod) and conducted a CMP evaluation using theseparticles. We investigated the e\ufb00ect of increasing calcinationtemperature on the physical properties of the particles. Therelationship between the physical properties of ceria par-ticles and the removal rate of PETEOS \ufb01lm was thus identi\ufb01ed. As calcination temperature increased, the crys- tallization degree of the particles increased and the ceriaslurry for the STI CMP process had a higher removal rate forPETEOS \ufb01lm. It can be concluded that the grain size is thekey factor accounting for the increase in the PETEOSremoval rate with the calcination temperature.

The ceria abrasives were prepared by the \ufb02ux method, using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the grain growth accelerator.

Introduction Ceria is receiving intense attention as a main slurry component for the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process in semiconductor manufacturing industry due to the effective removal rate for oxide \ufb01lm and the softness of the particles [1,2]. Ceria-based slurry has been used in CMP of shallow trench isolation (STI) structures consisting of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride deposition due to its high selectivity over nitride. For the STI-CMP process, the use of high selectivity slurries is very important to halt the polishing at the nitride stop layer and reduce the amount of defects such as erosion and dishing [3]. During the past decade, structural properties, chemical aspects and morphological characteristics of the ceria abrasives have been identi \ufb01ed as the important parameters that in \ufb02uence the STI-CMP performance [4,5]. Therefore, many approaches to control these properties of ceria abrasives have been extensively investigated. The commercial method for synthesis of ceria particles involves thermal decomposition of cerium salts such as carbonate and hy- droxide [6]. This method leads to very porous ceria particles with high surface area, inducing softness and high chemical reactivity to oxide \ufb01lms. However, the size and the shape of ceria abrasives are very limited since particle growth is dif \ufb01cult to control during calcination process. To achieve the desired particle size and the uniform particle size distribution, mechanical milling and \ufb01lteration is required [7]. Other methods for preparing ceria abrasives are liquid phase pro- cesses [8,9]. These methods can lead to ceria abrasives with desirablemorphological characteristics by manipulating reaction parameters. However, the size of ceria abrasives is limited to less than 50 nm. Use of these small size particles results in low removal rates of target layers during CMP. To overcome these problems, \ufb02ux method is proposed to synthe- size the ceria abrasives with a well-de \ufb01ned morphology. This method consists of adding precursor in the required ratio to a molten salt mixture, which accelerates the kinetics of the formation of ceria particles [10]. The ceria particles obtained by this method have the several advantages over other methods such as narrow size distribu- tion, desirable characteristics including very \ufb01ne size, high chemical purity and good chemical homogeneity [11]. However, this method has seldom been applied to the synthesis of ceria abrasives for CMP slurry. Furthermore, the polishing performance of ceria abrasives synthesized using \ufb02ux method has not been reported so far for the silica and silicon nitride \ufb01lms. In this work, we synthesized the ceria particles of different sizes with uniform particle size distribution using the \ufb02ux method. For CMP performance evaluation, the effect of ceria abrasives on the removal rate, the oxide-nitride removal selectivity and the within-wafer non uniformity (WIWNU) was investigated. 2. Experiment 2.1. Preparation of ceria abrasive particles by solid state reaction Cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3)3\u22196H2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were used as the starting materials for synthesis of ceria abrasive particles. 0.5 M of cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate and 1.0 M of potassium hydroxide were separately dissolved in mixedPowder Technology 206 (2011) 239 \u2013245 \u204eCorresponding author.

    "solvent of ethylene glycol (C 2H6O2) and deionized (DI) water. The volume ratio of ethylene glycol to water was kept at 2:3. The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 50 \u00b0C with stirring rate of 100 rpm for 12 h. Air was bubbled into the precipitation reactor with passage through a gas distributor as an oxidizer. The precipitated substance was separated via centrifugation and then redispersed in distilled water under continuous stirring. The weight ratio of distilled water toa precipitated substance was kept 5:1. The suspension solution was put into an autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 230 \u00b0C for 6 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the precipitated particles were washed with distilled water three times via centrifu- gation and then uniformly wetted in a potassium hydroxide/water mixed solution. The concentration of potassium hydroxide was 0.1 \u2013 2.0 wt.% depending on the total weight of the precipitated particles. The wetted particles were sintered for 2 h at 800 \u2013900 \u00b0C temperature. The synthesized particles were washed with distilled water until the ion conductivity of the washed solution was less than 0.5 \u03bcS. The schematic diagram of experimental procedure was shown in Fig. 1 . The crystal structure and grain size were identi \ufb01ed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuK \u03b1radiation. The crystallite size was esti- mated by the Scherrer equation according to the formula D=0.9 \u03bb/(\u03b2 cos\u03b8), where Dis crystallite size, \u03bbis the wavelength of X-rays, \u03b2is the half-width of the diffraction peaks, and \u03b8is the diffraction angle. The broadening of the re \ufb02ection from the (111) plane was used to calculate the crystallite size. The morphology and sizes of the abrasive particles were also examined by \ufb01eld emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The average primary particle size was calculated by measuring ca. 100 particles from FESEM micrographs. The speci \ufb01c surface area (SSA) of ceria abrasives was determined by Brunauer \u2013 Emmett \u2013Teller (BET) method using nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K. 2.2. Polishing of wafers Different ceria-based slurries were formulated by dispersing abrasives each with different primary particle sizes in DI water containing an anionic organic polymer (Poly acrylic acid, PAA; Mw 4000, LG Chem.) as dispersant. The PAA was 2 wt.% based on the total weight of the ceria abrasives. For each slurry, pH was adjusted to 6.5 \u20136.7 by adding ammonium hydroxide (NH 4OH). The solid loading of ceria abrasives was \ufb01xed to 2.0 wt.%. Table 1 presents the slurry character- istics used in polishing tests. The abrasive size distribution of slurry was measured using light scattering method (UPA 150, Microtrac Inc.). In order to investigate the adsorption characteristics of ceria abrasives for the additive polymer, slurry A and D were dried at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. Theweight loss of the abrasives dried from slurries was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was performed in an air \ufb02ow of 100 ml/min at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min from 30 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C. Silicon dioxide \ufb01lm of 2 \u03bcm thick was formed on a 5-in. p-type silicon substrates with (001) orientation by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The silicon nitride \ufb01lms were deposited by using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Polishing tests were performed on a rotary type CMP machine (GNP POLI 400, G&P technology) for 1 min with each of the ceria-based slurries. IC 1000/SUBA IV stacked pads (supplied by Rodel Inc.) were utilized as CMP pads. The downforce was 280 g/cm2and the rotation speed between the pad and the wafer was 90 rpm. The slurry \ufb02ow rate was 100 mL/min. The \ufb01lm thickness on the wafers before and after CMP was measured using spectroscopic re \ufb02ectometry (Nanospec 6100, Nanometrics) to calculate the removal rate. In this experiment, the WIWNU was de \ufb01ned as the standard deviation of remaining thickness divided by the average of the remaining thickness after the CMP process. The average polishing data for removal rate was carried by performing the same tests more than three times in order to support the validity of the results from the statistical viewpoint. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Morphological characteristics of ceria abrasives Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of abrasive particles prepared in different calcination conditions as described in Table 1 . The primary particle sizes determined using the FESEM micrographs were 84, 166, 295, and 417 nm for slurry A, B, C and D, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 , the ceria particles consisted of crystalline grains with a well- de\ufb01ned morphology. The size of ceria particles increased with the increase in concentration of potassium hydroxide and the calcination temperature. These images indicate that the primary particle size can be controlled by changing the calcination conditions, which in \ufb02uence the crystal growth of ceria particles. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared particles. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the characteristic peaks correspond- ing to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes are located at 2\u03b8=28.51, 33.06, 47.48, 56.20, and 59.05o, respectively. They show very close to the ones with cubic \ufb02uorite structure of ceria crystal in JCPDS database. The sharp intensity peaks were observed for ceria abrasives with larger primary particle size as shown in Fig. 3 (b). The crystallite size of ceria abrasives was calculated from the Scherrer equation using the line-broadening of the (111) peak in the XRD pattern. The crystallite size gradually increased from 38 nm to 88 nm as the calcination temperature and the concentration of additive were increased. This result coincides with the trend of increasing primary particle size in the FESEM images shown in the Fig. 2 . The synthesis method employed in this study is characterized by a low sintering temperature process, using grain growth accelerator. The eutectic mixed solvents as an accelerator is used to promote the kinetics by enhancing diffusion, due to their low melting temperature. In this study, potassium hydroxide/water mixed solvent was used as the accelerator to reduce sintering temperature. Considering that the Fig. 1.

    "conventional sintering of ceria requires high temperatures leading to partial reduction above 1200 \u00b0C [12], potassium hydroxide/water mixed solvent might offer a liquid phase to promote interdiffusion on contact surface between the smaller particle and the larger ones during the sintering process. Fig. 4 shows this dependence of the crystallite size on the concentration of potassium hydroxide at a \ufb01xed temperature (850 \u00b0C). It can be observed that an increase in the crystallite size was seen with addition of KOH at same calcination temperature. These results indicate that potassium hydroxide strongly affects the growth rate of ceria particles at relatively low temperature. Therefore, the physical properties and the morphology of ceria abrasives could be controlled by manipulating the concen- tration of potassium hydroxide in this system. Additionally, cerium dioxide particles obtained by hydrothermal method were used as the precursor in this study, instead of cerium salts such as hydroxide, nitride, and chloride. Fig. 5 shows the FESEM images of the particles prepared with different cerium precursors. Compared with other particles as shown in Fig. 5 (a), (b), and (c), it can be observed that the uniformity of ceria particles ( Fig. 5 (d)) prepared using oxide is superior. This result is attributed to the fact that in case of cerium dioxide as a precursor, direct grain growth of crystallite is involved during heat treatment. However, in case of other precursors (hydroxide, nitride and chloride), the formation of cerium dioxide crystallites involves two steps via thermal decomposition followed by grain growth. Thermal decomposition of such precursors involve series of chemical reactions [13]leading to retarded growth of ceria particles. Furthermore, it is dif \ufb01cult to achieve uniform ceria particle morphology because of the high surface energy and chemical reactivity of the volatile cerium compounds. Therefore, it seems that the direct formation to ceria induces the absence of hard aggregates and surface necking in the ceria crystallites.3.2. Characteristics of ceria abrasives before and after CMP To investigate the CMP performance using the synthesized ceria abrasives, we performed polishing test for the four types of slurries with different abrasive size. Fig. 6 shows the particle size distribution of these slurries without surfactant addition. The average particle sizes determined by light scattering method were 165, 278, 483, and 742 nm for slurry A, B, C and D, respectively. The dispersed particle size is much larger than the crystallite size estimated by X-rays and the primary particle size calculated by FESEM. This observation is due to the extensive overlapping of the ceria particles in water-based solution [14]. As shown in Fig. 6 , the increase in the size of the primary particle led to broader particle size distribution in water-based solution. Fig. 7 shows the FESEM images of ceria abrasives before and after silicon dioxide polishing for slurry C. The ceria abrasives after polishing were washed with distilled water three times via centrifugation. According to Fig. 6 , we can con \ufb01rm that the ceria abrasives are brittle and break during polishing process. This indicates that the ceria abra- sives used in this study are easily broken-down by applied pressure and shear force during polishing. 3.3. Polishing test Table 2 summarizes the quantitative results of the polishing test. It is clear that the removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lms increased with increas- ing size of ceria abrasives. The removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm is mainly in\ufb02uenced by chemical contribution of ceria abrasives and mechanical factors, such as the CMP conditions, morphological characteristics of abrasives and particles size distribution. During the polishing of the oxide \ufb01lm, ceria abrasives exhibit a chemical tooth property which Fig. 2. FESEM photographs of the ceria abrasives prepared with different calcination conditions; (a) slurry A, (b) B, (c) C and (d) D.241 M.-H. Oh et al. / Powder Technology 206 (2011) 239 \u2013245",
    "accelerates the polishing removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm[1].A sa consequence, the Si \u2013O\u2013Ce bonds can be rapidly removed by the mechanical force generated by pressed pad and abrasives, and this physicochemical reaction lead to the high removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm. Inthis work, it was found that the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm was essentially dependent on the size of ceria abrasives. As with the removal rate of oxide \ufb01lm, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm increased with increasing in the crystallite size of ceria abrasives. However, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm is affected by the physical properties of ceria-based slurry systems and the amount of surfactant adsorbed on the \ufb01lm surface [5]. In order to improve the selectivity and uniformity, an anionic acrylic polymer is commonly used to passivate the surface of the nitride \ufb01lm during STI-CMP, which prevents ceria abrasives from contacting the \ufb01lm surface [15]. In this study, the amount of the polymer was maintained constant for all slurry. Therefore, it seems that the increase in the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm is relate to the mechanical factors rather that to the effect of passivation layer of the polymer absorbed on the\ufb01lm surface. These mechanical factors are in \ufb02uenced by several physical parameters of the CMP process, such as morphological aspects of the abrasives, crystallite size of the abrasives and the CMP conditions. It is well known that the removal rate increases with increasing particle size due to mechanical indentation. However, the increase in removal rate shows lower slope between slurry C and D as compared to that from slurry A to C as shown in Fig. 8 . This led to a transition in removal selectivity between oxide and nitride \ufb01lm at slurry C. This result is attributed to two related factors: the contact-area reduction and the particle surface activity. In the case of oxide CMP process, the removal rate is mainly affected by contact area between the abrasives and the \ufb01lm surface. According to contact-area mechanism [16], the removal rate increases with decreasing abrasive size and increasing solid loading, due to the increase in contact-area between the abrasives and the \ufb01lm surface. At a \ufb01xed solid loading, the number of ceria abrasives in slurry decrease as the abrasive size increases. This implies the decrease in contact area between ceria abrasives in slurry D and oxide \ufb01lm during CMP processing. Additionally, large abrasives with round-shape lead to the decrease in interfacial contact with \ufb01lm surface, due to their rolling motion [17]. Furthermore, relatively lower removal rate are attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of slurry on the wafer. For the slurry D, the broader size distribution induces a loss in the frictional occasion of smaller abrasives by bigger abrasives and a local friction interaction of bigger abrasives on the wafer. The frictional force between the abrasives and the wafer is decreased by using slurry D because the frictional force is directly proportional to the contact area [18]. These polishing behaviors would lead to a relatively lower increase in removal rate for the oxide wafer during CMP. In this study, such behavior can be clearly seen from the change in oxide removal rate from slurry A to C and slurry C to D. As shown in Fig. 8 , the removal rate rapidly increased from 1662 \u00c5/min for 84 nm to 3990 \u00c5/min for 295 nm, whereas it slightly increased to 4343 nm for 417 nm in spite of size effect of bigger abrasives during CMP process. In case of the nitride \ufb01lm CMP, the polishing behavior can be explained by the relationship between additive polymer and abrasive size. The additive polymer can be more easily attached on the surface of the small abrasives than on the surface of large ones, due to high surface activity and speci \ufb01c surface area of the small abrasives. The slurry with small abrasives can induce a relatively high removal rate for nitride \ufb01lm, since the passivation layer is insuf \ufb01ciently formed on the nitride \ufb01lm surface as polymer is largely adsorbed on the particle surface. As described in Table 1 , the speci \ufb01c surface area decreased with increasing abrasive size. Moreover, the compositional changes associated with the additive polymer adsorbed on the surface of ceria abrasives were investigated with thermal analysis. Fig. 9 presents the TGA curves of the ceria abrasives dried from slurry A and D. The TGA curves of the ceria abrasives show two weight losses (curve (a) and (b)). The initial weight loss below the temperature of 100 \u00b0C can be attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed water in the air. The second weight loss observed at 200 \u2013260 \u00b0C is related to the decomposition of the additive polymer adsorbed on the abrasive surface. As shown in Fig. 9 ,\ufb01nal weight loss for two abrasives was different because the additive polymer content adsorbed on Fig. 3.

    "abrasive surface was different. This means that removal rate for nitride \ufb01lms can be relatively increased in spite of decrease in the abrasive size. As a result, the removal rate of nitride \ufb01lm showed relatively low increase in rate with increase in the abrasive size. Therefore, these polishing behaviors for oxide and nitride \ufb01lms result in the transition of removal selectivity, suggestive of existence of an optimum size of ceria abrasives for high removal selectivity. Additionally, the results for surface uniformity of the oxide \ufb01lms are shown in Fig. 10 . As the size of ceria abrasives increased, the slurry had a higher WIWNU for the oxide \ufb01lm. This polishing behavior is Fig. 5.

    "attributed to a broader particle size distribution of the slurry with large abrasives. The distribution data in Fig. 6 showed that the slurry has a rather-wide particle size distribution as abrasive particles in- creases. The broader particle size distribution of large abrasives can cause a different removal rate between the center and the edges of the\ufb01lm surface due to their limited mobility on the wafer surface. Consequently, the surface uniformity deteriorated with increasing abrasive size during CMP process. It seems that surface uniformity of oxide \ufb01lm is related to the mechanical factors of ceria abrasives rather that to the morphological factors on the \ufb01lm surface.4. Conclusions In this study, we investigated the effects of ceria abrasives on polishing performance during silicon dioxide and silicon nitride CMP. The ceria abrasives with controllable size were synthesized using the \ufb02ux method. The size of the ceria abrasives was controlled by changing the calcination conditions without mechanical milling process. With increasing abrasive size, the removal rate of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride \ufb01lms increased. On the other hand, the surface uniformity deteriorated after CMP process, due to a wide particle size distribution of the slurry with large abrasives. In addition, the removal selectivity showed a transition behavior at the slurry C (with particle size of 295 nm). This result indicates that there exists an optimum for removal selectivity as a function of abrasive size in the used slurry system. Therefore, we concluded that the control of the size and uniform particlesize distribution of ceria abrasives is an important parameter for high removal selectivity and surface uniformity in the CMP process.

It is widely believed that slurry is one of the important CMP consum- able materials [1 ]. In the logic chip manufacturing process, there are many dielectric CMP processes [2 ], such as Shal- low Trench Isolation (STI), Inter-level Dielectric (ILD) and Ploy Silicon Open (POP) process, which need CeO2 based * Xinchun Lu xclu@tsinghua.edu.cn1 State Key Laboratory of Tribology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China",

The synthesis [ 4] of CeO2 nanoparticles in CeO2 based slurry gains continuous emphasis on improving its performance in the CMP of dielectric materials. The physical properties of CeO2 nanoparticles in CeO2 based slurry are significantly affected by the category and circumstance of synthesis [5 ]. The CMP performances of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized by different categories [6 ] and circumstances have been extensively investigated [7 ]. Calcination is a straightforward access to acquire CeO2 nanoparticles [8 ]. Calcined CeO2 has high SiO2 Material Removal Rate (MRR) [9 ] and good within-wafer uniform- ity [7 ]. Previous studies [10] have shown that the higher the calcination temperature, the higher the CMP MRR of ceria [11]. Ceria calcined at 900 \u2103 has the highest MRR [12]. However, calcined CeO2 is prone to sintering and agglomeration at high calcination temperatures [13]. In general, calcined CeO2 usually requires subsequent milling processes [14] to achieve the desired size [15], which con- sumes considerable energy [16]. Therefore, a new method that can prevent agglomeration during the calcination of ceria particle must be proposed. In this work, urea was selected to dominate the growth of particle during the calcination process. Therefore, the find- ings in the manuscript provide the correlation between the growth state of CeO2 nanoparticles and the calcination pro- cess controlled by urea [17]. In addition, the dispersion and CMP performance of the CeO2 nanoparticles were measured. 2 Experimental Procedure 2.1 Synthesis of Materials Calcination thermal decomposition was a common and widespread process to synthesize CeO2. In this research, Ce2(CO3)3\u00b76H2O was used as the source of ceria. Urea and Ce2(CO3)3\u00b76H2O were mixed as a 1:1 molar ratio to get a uniform paste. The other was prepared without urea. The paste was exsiccated to solid under a constant tem- perature oil bath condition at 70 \u2103 . The solid was calcined in muffle furnace at 900 \u2103 with a heating rate at 10 \u00b0C/ min, maintained at a constant temperature for 10 h and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. The process of the synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles with urea is shown in Fig. 1. The decomposition behavior of two kinds of exsic- cated solid was monitored by thermal gravimetric apparatus (TGA/DSC1, Mettler Toledo) up to 900 \u2103 at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in air. 2.2 Materials Characterization The size and morphology of CeO2 were observed by scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8200, Hitachi). The lattice structure and grain size were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2550, Rigaku) using a Cu-K\u03b1 X-ray source (40 kV, 40 mA) in the range of 20\u201390\u00b0. The valence states of cerium were carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera II, Ulvac-Phi). The fraction of Ce3+ was calculated based on the deconvolution [18] of Ce 3d spin-orbit doublet using Casa XPS. 2.3 CMP Process CeO2 nanoparticles calcined with urea were dispersed in deionized water, the mass content of the dispersion was 0.3%, and the pH of the dispersion was adjusted by nitric acid and ammonia [19]. The CeO2 dispersions were prepared by continuous ultrasonication and stirring for 10 h. The particle size of dispersed CeO2 nanoparticles was measured by a laser particle size analyzer (380ZLS, PSS). The Zeta potential of dispersed CeO2 nanoparticles was measured by a zeta potential analyzer (90Plus PALS, Brookhaven). 50 mm Plasma-Enhanced Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (PETEOS) silicon oxide wafers were prepared by SKW Associates, Inc. for CMP process. The thicknesses of the as-deposited oxide were 10 kA. Wafers were polished on a CMP machine (Universal-150Plus, Hwatsing) with a CMP pad (DH3010, Dinglong). Ex-situ conditioning was car - ried out with a diamond dresser (A165, 3 M) before each polishing. The head/platen rotational speed was 87/93 rpm, the slurry flow rate was 150 ml/min, and the down pressure was 3 psi. The main polishing time is 60 s. The commercial slurry for comparison is Ces333F from AGC. The MRR of CMP process was calculated by the thick - ness difference of wafers [20] before and after CMP process that were measured by by Filmetrics (F50, Filmetric). The surface quality after CMP process was observed by atomic force microscope (AFM, Icon, Bruker). The average rough- ness (Ra) was determined within 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 \u00b5m2.

    "582 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 1 3 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Surface Morphology of CeO2 Nanoparticles The SEM images of the CeO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2, which provide the information of particle mor - phology. The shape of the CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea is near-spherical and shows good monodisperse properties. It is clear that the particle sizes of the two kinds of CeO2 are around 60 nm. CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea are obviously agglomerated to form a strip particle combination. CeO2 usually has a strong precur - sor inheritance during the calcination process, so the strip particle combination is likely to be the morphology of cerium carbonate [21]. However, when urea is involved in the calcination pro- cess, the growth and combination of CeO2 nanoparticles are significantly changed. This phenomenon can be attrib - uted to the thermal condensation reaction of urea [22]. The condensation reaction of urea occurs in the two-way reaction of dissolution and precipitation of cerium carbon- ate. The condensation product has a template effect so that CeO2 nanoparticles can grow in a monodisperse form [23]. The results of thermogravimetry experiments are shown in Fig. 3, which could reflect the changes of phase in the calcination process. In the TG curve of the calci- nation process without urea, the low weight loss within lower temperature range (\u2264 100 \u00b0C) indicates that there is no loss of crystal water in the process. This result shows that the exsiccation process at 70 \u00b0C was suffi- cient. The rapid weight loss from 240 to 290 \u00b0C indicates that cerium carbonate was rapidly decomposed. The TG curve of the calcination process with urea is more com- plex. The slow weight loss begins at 80 \u00b0C, which could be explained that urea began to react. Subsequently, the decline rate of the curve changed at 240 \u00b0C. Cerium car - bonate began to decompose. Contrary to the previous rapid decline, the decomposition of cerium carbonate gradually completed with the increase of temperature. This result shows that the decomposition of cerium Fig. 2 SEM images of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized (a), (c) without urea and (b), (d) with urea Fig. 3 Thermogravimetry (TG) curves of CeO2 nanoparticles synthe- sized with urea and without urea",
    "583 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 1 3 carbonate and the growth of CeO2 were affected by urea condensation products. 3.2 Surface and Structural Properties XPS spectra in Figs. 4 and 5 show the difference of the con- centration of Ce3+ between two kinds of CeO2 nanoparticles. Table 1 shows the concentration of Ce3+ in the CeO2 nanopar - ticles conducted by peak deconvolution of XPS spectra [24]. Figure 6 shows the crystalline phase information of the CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea and with urea by XRD. The XRD patterns of CeO2 nanoparticles remain the typical pattern of fluorite structure and correspond well with the standard data of JCPDS No. 34-0394 [ 25]. Accord - ing to the Debye-Scherrer equation, the crystallite size could be calculated based on the broadening of the diffraction peak and the Bragg angle [26]. There are almost no differences in the concentration of Ce3+ and crystallite size between the two kinds of CeO2 nanoparticles. Because of the presence of urea, the crystal- linity of the product decreased slightly. However, urea con- densation could not change the surface and structural prop- erties of CeO2 nanoparticles. This result further confirms that the urea condensation reaction only acts as a physical template. The CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea have the similar physical and chemical properties to general calcined ceria. 3.3 CMP Performance Figure 7 compares the particle size of the two kinds of CeO2 nanoparticles with different pH measured by dynamic light scattering [27]. Figure 7a shows that the mean diameter of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea is approxi- mately 600 nm with a wide distribution range. Figure 7b\u2013d show that the CeO2 nanoparticles synthe- sized with urea have good dispersion. Simultaneously, the particle size had good stability and did not fluctuate greatly with the change of pH value [28]. Table 2 shows the standard deviation of DLS particle sizes. Compared with the initial particle size without regulating pH, the mean diameter was smaller and the particle size distri- bution was more concentrated at pH = 4 and pH = 10. Table 2 also shows the Zeta potential of CeO2 dispersion prepared by nanoparticles synthesized with urea at differ - ent pH value. This result is consistent with the results of Table 1 The concentration of Ce3+ of CeO2 Synthesized with and without urea With urea Without urea The concentration of Ce3+16.90% 16.27% Crystallinity 97.70% 99.31% Crystallite size (nm) 62.2 62.5 Fig. 4 XPS spectra of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea Fig. 5 XPS spectra of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea Fig. 6 XRD patterns of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea and without urea",

Meanwhile, when the pH is not regulated, that is, the pH is close to the iso- electric point of ceria, the absolute value of Zeta potential of CeO2 dispersion is lower and the dispersion is slightly worse, which also corresponds to the increase of mean particle size. This phenomenon indicates that the CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea could be used as a Fig. 7 DLS particle sizes of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized (a) without urea and (b) with urea dispersed in water; synthesized with urea dis- persed in water at (c) pH = 4 and (d) pH = 10 Table 2 The DLS particle size and Zeta potential of CeO2 dispersion synthesized with urea pH = 4 Unregulated pH = 10 Mean diameter (nm) 235.3 265.7 243 Standard deviation 100.9 111.8 75.8 Zeta potential (mV) 32.66 \u221212.79 \u221223.29 Fig. 8 MRR of PETEOS during CMP and surface roughness after CMP by using CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea dispersed in water at different pH value compared with commercial slurry",
    "585 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 1 3 good basic material for the subsequent development of multifunctional CMP slurry [29]. The MRR of PETEOS of CMP experiments are shown in Fig. 8. The initial ceria without regulating pH showed a higher MRR because of the bigger mean diameter. The MRR of PETEOS was higher in acidic slurry (at pH 4) than that in alkaline slurry (at pH 10), mainly due to the different elec- trostatic interactions between abrasive and the wafer surface [30]. Three kinds of slurries all exhibited higher MRR than commercial slurry. The micro topographies after CMP process observed by AFM are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. AFM results clearly reveal that CMP process using the CeO2 dispersion prepared by nanoparticles synthesized with urea achieve ultra-smooth and damage-free surfaces. The surface roughness (Ra) results after CMP process are shown in Fig. 8. The CeO2 dispersion prepared by Fig. 9 2D-AFM height images of surfaces after CMP process by using CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea dispersed in water at (a) pH = 4, (b) unregulated pH and (c) pH = 10, compared with using (d) commercial slurry",
    "586 Electronic Materials Letters (2023) 19:580\u2013587 1 3 nanoparticles synthesized with urea at unregulated pH has a relatively poor surface quality due to the lower absolute value of Zeta potential and larger particle size. Compared with commercial slurry, acidic slurry (at pH 4) and alkaline slurry (at pH 10) both have a better sur - face quality. These CMP results also increase the possibility of subse- quent development of multifunctional CMP slurry. 4 Conclusions Urea was selected to dominate the growth and morphology during the calcination process. The urea condensation prod- ucts made the calcined CeO2 exhibit good monodisperse characteristics by affecting the decomposition of cerium carbonate and the growth of CeO2. At the same time, the urea condensation reaction did not affect the crystal struc - ture and surface properties of the calcined CeO2. The CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea condensation had good dispersion in water at a wide pH value and satisfactory CMP performance. The CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea condensation not only yielded better surface quality results than the commercial slurry but also showed a 153% (pH = 4) and 100% (pH = 10) increase in the material removal rate of silicon oxide compared to commercial. The result of this research greatly reduces the energy consumption and time in the synthesis of calcined CeO2 slurry. This research pro- vides a broad prospect for the subsequent development of CMP slurry. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51991370).

    "Synthesis of crystalline cerium dioxide hydrosol by a sol\u2013gel method Hong-Wei Heb, Xiao-Qing Wub,*, Wei Renb, Peng Shib, Xi Yaob, Zhi-Tang Songa aShanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050, China bElectronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an 710049, China Available online 24 May 2011 Abstract A nano-cerium dioxide hydrosol was synthesized via a sol\u2013gel process at the range of room temperature to 65 8C with the nonionic surfactant PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone). The mixture solution of cerium nitrate and urea turned out a visible chemical reaction under the catalysis of ammonia. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicated the colloidal ingredient and nano-crystal structural information. The colloid was crystalline face-centered cubic nano-structured cerium dioxide. The sizes of CeO 2colloids are in the range of several nanometers to 10 nm or more. The application of the hydrosol may focus on the ceria-based polishing agent for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. # 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved. Keywords: A. Sol\u2013gel processes; D. CeO 2; Nonionic surfactant PVP; CMP 1. Introduction Cerium dioxide is one of the most important rare-earth oxide, of which application \ufb01elds include industrial catalysts [1,2] , solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) [3,4] , polishing abrasive [5,6] and other \ufb01elds. Especially, CeO 2polishing abrasive for STI-CMP (Shallow Trench Isolation Chemical Mechanical Polishing) has been received widely attention in recent years due to its excellent selectivity and ef\ufb01ciency. To satisfy polishing requirements, a variety of cerium oxide synthesis methods have been extensively studied to increase cerium dioxide performance in STI-CMP process, such as precipita- tion, sol\u2013gel, hydrothermal, physical chemistry, and high- energy dispersion. As we known, the commercial abrasive particles are usually prepared by means of calcination, gas combustion or high- energy ball milling dispersion, easily leading to irregular shape, severe agglomeration, uneven distribution of particles. These disadvantages resulted in the scratches and defects of polished surface, and limited the CeO 2abrasive further application in the decreasing feature size of integrated circuits in the semi- conductor industry.In this paper, we proposed to replace CeO 2-calcinated abrasive with CeO 2-colloid abrasive in order to reduce polishing defects. Otherwise, the synthesized colloids should be crystalline ceria to keep its high polishing selectivity. 2. Experimental The synthesis process was similar to the reference [7,8] . The details were described as follows (Fig. 1): cerium source Ce(NO 3)3/C16H2O, buffer CO(NH 2)2and dispersant PVP were dissolved into a certain amount of deionized water with a magnetic stirrer. The temperature of the mixture solution gradually increased from room temperature to the set temperature, and the solution should be kept stirring for 1 h. Then, an appropriate amount of ammonia was added dropwise with a burette. The reaction quickly happened within a few seconds, and the solution color underwent obviously change in few hours. The phenomenon of color change was believed to be correlated with the chemical changes. As the color of reaction solution turned from purple into pale yellow, the Ce3+happened to be oxidized into Ce4+by O2under air atmosphere. The possible chemical reaction is stated as the following formulas [9]: Ce\u00f0NO 3\u00de3/C16H2O \u00fe 3NH 3/C1H2O !

X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopy was measured by ESCALAB VG-MK-II to con\ufb01rm the oxidation state of the cerium.

Results and discussion In order to con\ufb01rm the possible compound in the powder sample for researching the actual reaction process, the sample was dried at room temperature in the semi-closed crucible for several days. The dried powder showed pale yellow, as the same color as the sol. Fig. 2 shows the TG\u2013DSC curves of the dried powder. The TG\u2013DSC patterns (in Fig. 2) showed the thermal behavior from room temperature up to 500 8C. The mass loss can be divided into four stages: The weight loss below 140 8C Fig. 1.

    "was due to the removal of physisorbed water. Decomposition of the structural water was in between 140 8C and 215 8C. The weight loss from 215 8C to 305 8C was attributed to the decomposition of a side product of cerium oxycarbonate [7], corresponding to a sharp exothermic peak at 291 8C in the DTA curve. The exothermic peak around 450 8C might be caused by the oxidation of cerium compound. So, it could be concluded that the synthesized product contained not only ceria but also some other materials. As we know, the crystal structure of pure ceria is a face- centered cubic structure, grouped into the calcium \ufb02uoride (CaF 2) structural type with space group Fm3m. The XRD pattern of the dried ceria colloids (Fig. 3) showed a good agreement with literature data (JCPDS No. 34-0394). The main Bragg peaks with Miller indices (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), and (4 0 0) could be found clearly. The pure crystallized ceria could be obtained at lower temperature. Fig. 4 depicts the XPS spectrum of the CeO 2nanoparticles. Peaks of Ce 3d and O 1s proved the existence of cerium oxide. Ce 3d binding energy (BE) peaks were consistent with that of Ce4+ions. The band at 918.1 eV should be one of the 3d104f0 state of the Ce4+ions [10,11] , compared with the band of 916.5 eV BE in the reference [12], the upward shift of binding energy value may be due to smaller particle size. Here, the software of XPSPEAK41 was used to mark and \ufb01t the Ce 3d peaks.The aqueous solution with concentration of 0.1 mol L/C01 cerium was adopted for synthesis of ceria colloids. The content of PVP was 30 g L/C01. The TEM images of ceria colloids synthesized at different temperatures for 72 h are shown in Fig. 5. Obviously, the sample synthesized at 25 8C had severe colloid agglomeration (Fig. 5(a)). However, the sample synthesized at 65 8C (Fig. 5(b)) indicated a better dispersing behavior. Lower temperature might restrain the dispersion effect of PVP so that leaded to a bad dispersion performance. It means that the dispersion effect of PVP requires a proper temperature. Generally, the content of ceria colloids in the solution depends on the concentration of cerium salt in reaction precursor. In the study, the samples with different cerium contents were synthesized to con\ufb01rm the limit concentration of ceria hydrosol. The experimental results shown: with increas- ing concentration of cerium salt in the solution, the precipitation started to appear gradually. When the concentra- tion of cerium reached up to 0.2 mol L/C01, the colloids in thesolution could not keep its suspension state and formed precipitation totally. Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of two kinds of cerium concentration samples. It could be found that each colloid was consisted of several 10-nm-size crystal particles, and ceria colloids were not monodispersed actually. The CeO 2 colloids obtained from the solution of 0.05 mol L/C01cerium (a) possessed a better dispersion performance than that of Fig. 7.

    "0.1 mol L/C01cerium (b). The experimental facts indicated the stability of ceria hydrosol is relative to the concentration of cerium salt. Fig. 7(a)\u2013(c) shows TEM images of the samples prepared at different reaction times. It could be seen that the effect of reaction time on crystallinity of ceria is obvious. With increase of reaction time, the reciprocal lattice of patterns became more and more evident, which proved a well-crystallized ceria. Size of the ceria colloids not changed obviously with increase of reaction time. Ceria particles are easy to form aggregation. To verify the stability of cerium oxide hydrosol, the sample stored three months was measured by TEM. The colloids had no signi\ufb01cant further agglomeration compared with fresh sample (similar to Fig. 7). The hydrosol is stable enough for application. 4. Conclusions Well-dispersed ceria hydrosol was obtained via the sol\u2013gel process at 65 8C. The ceria colloids possessed face-centered cubic CaF 2structure. The grain size is in the range of several nanometers to more than 10 nm. The hydrosol also exhibited a good aging stability in three months. References [1] S. Salomons, R.E. Hayes, M. V otsmeier, A.

The CeO 2abrasives with high chemical activity were prepared by the molten salt method under a reducing atmosphere. The crystal structure and morphology of CeO 2abrasives were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet evisible diffuse re \ufb02ectance spectroscopy (UV eVis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The CeO 2abrasives were obtained under different atmo- spheres (Air, Ar, and Ar/H 2). With the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, the morphology of the abrasives transforms from spherical to octahedral, while more oxygen vacancies and Ce3\u00feare generated on the surface of CeO 2abrasives. The CMP experiments show that the MRR sof the CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives on SiO 2substrates are 337.60, 578.74, and 691.28 nm/min, respectively. Moreover, as con\ufb01rmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the substrate surfaces exhibit low roughness (~0.5 nm) after being polished using all of the prepared samples. Especially, the MRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is increased by 104.76% compared with CeO 2-air abrasives. The improved CMP performance is attributed to the increased Ce3\u00feconcentration and the octahedral morphology of the abrasives enhancing the chemical reaction and mechanical removal at the abrasive esubstrate interface. \u00a92022 Chinese Society of Rare Earths.

Introduction CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing)1is a key technology in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes.2It mainly re- lies on chemical and mechanical synergy to realize the material's global \ufb02attening.3With the development of semiconductor process nodes, CMP technology has become more and more important and has become an indispensable planarization process for processes below 0.35 mm.4The slurry and pad of the polishing in the CMP system are the main consumables, and the polishing slurry as an active material can signi \ufb01cantly affect the polishing performance.Ceria is considered to be the most effective abrasive for polishing SiO 2substrates due to their unique physical and chemical proper- ties. With the increase in the number and density of multilayer wiring, the circle of CMP process steps has increased signi \ufb01cantly, and the impact on the yield of subsequent processes has become greater and greater. Therefore, it is a hot research topic to enhance the polishing ef \ufb01ciency by improving the chemical activity of the abrasive itself rather than increasing the polishing pressure (Higher downforce results in worse surface quality after CMP5). The \u201cchemical tooth \u201dtheory proposed by Cook6contributed to the study of the polishing mechanism of ceria-based abrasives. The formation and destruction of the Ce eOeSi bond between CeO 2 abrasives and SiO 2substrate is the key to realizing material removal. The role of Ce3\u00fein CeO 2abrasives in enhancing this re- action has been widely recognized by researchers. Srinivasan et al.7 discovered that Ce3\u00feon the surface of CeO 2abrasives is the key to achieving the removal of SiO 2materials. Kim et al.8studied the polishing performance of CeO 2abrasives with different speci \ufb01c surface areas and concluded that the small-sized CeO 2has a higher*Foundation item: Project supported by the National Natural Science Foun- dation of China (51905324), the Scienti \ufb01c Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (20JK0545), and the Doctoral Scienti \ufb01c Research Startup Foundation of Shaanxi University of Science and Technology (2018BJ-14). *Corresponding author.

    "polishing rate due to the higher Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface. Therefore, the defects on the ceria surface can enhance the chemical activity of the abrasive, which improves the polishing performance. Doping is a common way to enhance the chemical activity of nanoceria. Younis et al.9showed that Gd3\u00fedoping enhanced the degradation performance of CeO 2particles on organic dyes, and the enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of surface defects on CeO 2induced by ion doping. Cheng et al.10improved the polishing ef \ufb01ciency of CeO 2abrasives by modifying the surface of commercial particles by ion doping. Furthermore, Kim et al.11directly synthesized La3\u00feand Nd3\u00fedoped nano-ceria by a traditional hydrothermal method and con \ufb01rmed the signi \ufb01cant effect of doped abrasives on enhancing CMP per- formance for SiO 2substrates. These results are attributed to the increased Ce3\u00feconcentration on the CeO 2abrasive surface by ion doping. In the chip manufacturing process, a \ufb01ne post-CMP cleaning process is also required to remove the impurity adhesion after CMP.12The ion doping can increase the MRR, but post-cleaning of the wafer surface contaminated by impurity ions will become dif\ufb01cult, which will affect the chip quality and even damage the device.13Therefore, the preparation of CeO 2abrasives by control- ling atmospheric conditions without introducing impurity ions is an ideal way to increase the Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface. Choudhury et al.14prepared cerium oxide particles with high oxygen vacancy concentration under vacuum conditions, which exhibited better catalytic performance than CeO 2prepared under air. Lan and Sohn15studied cerium oxide prepared under different atmosphere conditions (Air, N 2,H 2), and the results showed that under a reducing atmosphere, cerium oxide has good catalytic performance due to the formation of more oxygen va- cancies. However, its wide particle size range and agglomeration behavior cannot be applied in the CMP \ufb01eld. Moreover, the rela- tionship between the oxygen vacancies of CeO 2surface and Ce3\u00fe concentration under the reducing atmosphere has not been deeply studied. To improve the polishing ef \ufb01ciency of conventional CeO 2 abrasives on SiO 2substrates, the CeO 2abrasives were prepared by the molten salt method in Air, Ar, and Ar/H 2atmospheres, respec- tively, to clarify the in \ufb02uence of CeO 2abrasives prepared in different atmospheres on the polishing performance of SiO 2sub- strate. Through detailed characterization studies, the evolution of crystal structure and micro-morphological of CeO 2abrasives were analyzed. Although the effect of Ce3\u00fein CeO 2abrasives on polishing performance has been con \ufb01rmed, the relationship between the atmospheric environment and the formation of Ce3\u00feon the abra- sive surface remains to be further elucidated. In this work, the in- \ufb02uence of reducing atmosphere on the concentration of Ce3\u00feon the abrasive surface was emphatically investigated. Moreover, the polishing performance of CeO 2abrasives prepared in reducing at- mosphere and air were compared, and the role of the prepared CeO 2abrasives on the removal ef \ufb01ciency of SiO 2substrate was investigated. Finally, the polishing mechanism of the CeO 2abra- sives was discussed through the comprehensive analysis of the morphology, defect characteristics, and polishing performance of the abrasives. To the best of our knowledge, the preparation of CeO 2 abrasives by reducing the atmosphere-assisted molten salt method to enhance the CMP performance on SiO 2substrates has not been found to be reported yet. 2. Experimental2.1. Chemical reagents Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3)3,6H2O), potassium chlo- ride (KCl), and sodium chloride (NaCl) are all analytical reagents,and they were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). Analytical reagent ethanol was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (China). Homemade deionized water was used throughout the experiment. All chemicals were used without further puri \ufb01cation. Ar (100% purity) and Ar/H 2(H2con- centration of 5%) were used for the experiments. 2.2. Preparation method The molten salt method was used to prepare CeO 2powder, and the synthesis steps were as follows. Firstly, the weighed Ce(N- O3)3,6H2O (2.1711 g), KCl (1.8638 g), and NaCl (1.4610 g) were well ground in an agate mortar. The raw materials in ethanol were mixed completely by magnetic stirring at 300 r/min for 30 min. The mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a constant temperature oven at 80/C14C to remove absolute ethanol. Then, the OTF-1200X eS tubular atmosphere furnace (Hefei Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd., China) was used to prepare a mixture containing ceria powder under a certain temperature regime (react at 800 and 700/C14C for 2 h, respectively). After cooling down to ambient temperature, the molten salts (KCl eNaCl) in the mixture were washed with hot deionized water to obtain high purity CeO 2 powder. In another experiment, the crucible containing themixture was heated in the tube furnace with a constant \ufb02ow (60 mL/min) of Ar or Ar/H 2, respectively, and in the same temper- ature regime to explore the effect of the surrounding atmosphere. In this work, the abrasives prepared under air, Ar, and Ar/H 2at- mospheres were named CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2, respectively. 2.3. Characterization methods Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders were recorded on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) under the condition of Cu K aradiation range of 20/C14e120/C14, and the scan- ning speed was \ufb01xed at 3(/C14)/min, the Rietveld re \ufb01nement of pow- ders was characterized using the GSAS program. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using an FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) within the IR range of 500 e4000 cm/C01. The morphology of the powders was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi Regulus 8100, Japan) under secondary electronic mode. Detailed information on morphology and struc- ture was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, USA). Ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectra were recorded with a Cary 5000 UV eViseNIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Tech- nologies, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scienti \ufb01c K-Alpha, USA) with Al K arays ( hv\u00bc1486.6 eV) as the excitation source was used for analysis at room temperature, and the binding energy was calibrated with adsorbed carbon (284.8 eV), and the semi-quantitative analysis of the atomic ratio was achieved by measuring the element peak area. 2.4. Polishing experiment The homemade CeO 2abrasive was dispersed in deionized water using a ball mill and run at 400 r/min for 5 h. After suf \ufb01cient dispersion, the slurry was diluted with deionized water to make the solid content 0.5 wt%, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with 1 mol/L NaOH solution. The slurry was stirred well by using a magnetic stirrer before the start of the CMP experiment. The quartz glass with the nominal speci \ufb01cations of 20 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness was purchased from Lianyungang Xiongtai Quartz Tech- nology Co., Ltd. A UNIPOL-1200S automatic pressure grinding and polishing machine (Shenyang Kejing Auto-instrument, Co., Ltd., China) equipped with a synthetic leather polishing pad (ShenyangN. Xu, J. Ma, Q. Liu et al. Journal of Rare Earths 41 (2023) 1627 e1635 1628",
    "Kejing Auto-instrument, Co., Ltd., China) was used for CMP exper- iments. The polishing parameters were set as follows: the platform speed was 80 r/min, the reverse speed of the polishing head was 80 r/min, the pressure applied by the head was 3.5 kg, and the pol- ishing time was 3 min, and the slurry supply rate was 50 mL/min. The polished quartz glass was cleaned repeatedly in deionized water by ultrasonic and dried for characterization of CMP perfor- mance. Surface morphology and roughness were examined by us- ing an atomic force microscope (AFM, Seiko SPA400-SP13800N, Japan) equipped with a silicon nitride tip in contact mode at a scan rate of 1.0 Hz over a scan area of 5 mm/C25mm. The weight of the workpiece was measured using a precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg. The polishing ef \ufb01ciency or material removal rate (MRR, nm/min) was calculated by the following Eq. (1).16: MRR \u00bcm0/C0m r/C2S/C2t(1) where m0and mare the mass of the workpiece before and after polishing, respectively, ris the density of the commercial quartz glass used (2.2 g/cm3),Sthe area of the workpiece ( p$cm2), and t the polishing time (3 min). In this experiment, the MRR and roughness data presented are the average of three experiments performed repeatedly. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Morphology and structure characterization of CeO 2abrasives The XRD patterns of the prepared CeO 2particles are recorded in Fig. 1 . All diffraction peaks of the samples match well with the CeO 2 phase of face-centered cubic (fcc) \ufb02uorite (JCPDS 34 e0394), and no other cerium oxides (Ce 2O3species) are found. The peak position analysis of each diffraction spectrum showed that the crystalstructure of CeO 2prepared under different atmospheres changed. The magni \ufb01cation of the diffraction peaks shows that the diffrac- tion peak positions of the samples synthesized under Ar and Ar/H 2 atmospheres are shifted to a higher angle, which may be due to thelattice contraction caused by more oxygen vacancies. The Rietveld re\ufb01nement of CeO 2samples was characterized using the GSAS program to further con \ufb01rm subtle changes in the structure of CeO 2 particles, as shown in Figs. S1(a ec). The Rietveld re \ufb01nement was attempted using a CeO 2phase with a face-centered cubic ( Fm-3m) structure. The red circle, the black line, and the blue line represent the recorded, calculated and different pro \ufb01les for the CeO 2powder, respectively. For all samples, the re \ufb01nement parameters ( Rp<7%, Rwp<9%, and Chi2<2) are within a accepted range, indicating that the results of re \ufb01nement are credible. The results show that the lattice constants and volume of CeO 2-Ar (0.54132 nm, 0.15862 nm3) and CeO 2-Ar/H 2(0.54130 nm, 0.15860 nm3) are smaller than CeO 2-Air (0.54137 nm, 0.15867 nm3). This further con \ufb01rms the formation of oxygen vacancies in the CeO 2crystal. The oxygen vacancies promote the conversion of Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00fefor unit cell charge bal- ance,17which is responsible for the increase in Ce3\u00feconcentration in CeO 2.18,19 The FT-IR spectra of the abrasives are shown in Fig. 2 . The spectra were studied to characterize changes in chemical bonds and molecular vibrations, and evaluate the formation of the abra- sives. The broad absorption band at 3456 cm/C01is due to the pres- ence of the H eOeH stretching mode attributed to the adsorbed water on the CeO 2abrasive surface.20e22The bands at 2927 and 2855 cm/C01indicate the C eH stretching mode of the methylene groups,21,23and the peak intensity is weakened after synthesis by reducing atmosphere, which indicates that the adsorption of CO 2by CeO 2particles is reduced. The bands located at 2160 and 2028 cm/C01 are due to the stretching vibration of C eH, and CH 2groups, asso- ciated with some of the organic moieties which get physically adsorbed on the surface during sample preparation and handling.21 The peaks between 1047 and 1630 cm/C01correspond to the Ce eO stretching vibrations attributed to the hydrogenated CeO 2sam- ple.20,21The enhancement of the vibrational peak with the reducing atmosphere indicates that the sensitivity of CeO 2abrasives to hy- droxyl groups is elevated, which favors the adsorption of abrasives to SiO 2substrates. Meanwhile, the existence of the peak at 716 cm/C01in the IR spectra is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibrations between O eCeeO atoms.23,24Furthermore, it veri\ufb01es the bonding of metal eoxygen existing in the CeO 2lattice, which is consistent with the XRD results. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the CeO 2abrasives synthesized under different atmospheres. There are signi \ufb01cant differences in the morphology of the particles. From Fig. 3 (aec), it can be seen that the CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives are spherical, polyhedral, and octahedral, respectively. Fig. 3 (d) shows the sche- matic diagram of the effect of the atmosphere on the morphology of the abrasives. It is considered that the morphology of CeO 2 particles is gradually transformed from spherical to octahedral withthe enhancement of the reducing atmosphere. The morphology of CeO 2abrasives is one of the factors affecting the CMP performance, and the detailed mechanism of the change of morphology of CeO 2 particles during the synthesis will be focused on in our next study.SEM images also show that all abrasives are in the size range of 200e300 nm, which weakens the in \ufb02uence of abrasive size effect on CMP results. The TEM images were acquired to further observe the morphology and structure of CeO 2abrasives. Obviously, with the enhancement of reducibility, the morphology of CeO 2particles changes signi \ufb01cantly. As indicated by the red marks in Figs. S2(a ec), the morphologies of CeO 2particles are spherical, Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the CeO 2abrasives prepared under the different atmospheres (Air, Ar, Ar/H 2). Fig. 2. FT-IR spectra of CeO 2abrasives prepared under the different atmospheres (Air, Ar, Ar/H 2).N. Xu, J. Ma, Q. Liu et al. Journal of Rare Earths 41 (2023) 1627 e1635 1629",
    "polyhedral, and octahedral in order, which is consistent with the SEM results. As shown in Figs. S2(d ef), the boundaries of CeO 2 particles can be observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, and the clear lattice fringe spacing of CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2particles are 0.318, 0.304 and 0.302 nm, respec- tively, which correspond to the CeO 2(111) plane. The results show that the spacing of CeO 2particles is slightly reduced with the enhancement of the reducibility of the atmosphere. This is attrib- uted to the lattice contraction caused by the generation of oxygen vacancies. UVeVis spectroscopy techniques can be used to obtain infor- mation on the oxidation state of metal oxide species. The infor- mation about the valence state of the Ce element in the preparedCeO 2samples was preliminarily analyzed by UV eVis spectros- copy.25It is considered that the absorption peak of CeO 2at 260 nm is attributed to Ce3\u00fe, and the absorption peak at 330 nm is attrib- uted to Ce4\u00fe.26,27Fig. 4 shows the UV eVis spectra of the as- prepared abrasives, CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have high peak intensities, indicating that CeO 2abrasives prepared under a reducing atmosphere can increase the Ce3\u00feconcentration. The CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have similar Ce3\u00fe concentrations.XPS is an analytical technique that detects the composition, chemical state, and concentration of elements on the material surface. The surface chemical composition and valence states of the CeO 2samples were analyzed by XPS spectroscopy. Fig. 5 (a) shows the XPS survey spectra of the particles. The spectra show that only Ce, O, and C elements are detected, and no Cl, Na, or K elements are present in the samples, which also indicates the synthesis of CeO 2 as a single phase. Numerous studies28e32have shown that the chemical activity of CeO 2material is closely related to the con- centrations of oxygen vacancy and Ce3\u00fe. Therefore, the \ufb01ne spectra of Ce 3d and O 1s were analyzed in detail by \ufb01tting. The spin eorbit splitting energies of the samples are 18.44, 18.44, and 18.30 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the reports.33The uand v are usually used to label the spin orbitals 3d 3/2and 3d 5/2, where the v0,v',u, and u' peaks are characteristic peaks of Ce3\u00feand the v,v\", v\"',u0,u\", and u\"' peaks belong to Ce4\u00fe.33,34As shown in Figs. S3(a ec), the nonlinear peak \ufb01tting method was used to identify the peaks of Ce3\u00feand Ce4\u00fe, indicating the presence of both Ce3\u00feand Ce4\u00festates in the samples. Table 1 shows the binding energies and peak areas of CeO 2samples (Air, Ar, Ar/H 2) repre- senting different Ce states. Using the semi-quantitative analysis of the integrated peak area, the Ce3\u00feconcentration could be calcu- lated according to Eq. (2).34Fig. 5 (b) shows the statistics of Ce3\u00fe concentration on the CeO 2abrasive surface. In this work, the Ce3\u00fe concentrations on the surface of CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2 abrasives were 23.03 at%, 29.58 at%, and 33.88 at%, respectively. The improvement of Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface in- creases with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, which was consistent with the UV eVis results. And this change indicates that there is a state transition between Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00fe, which is excellent for enhanced polishing ef \ufb01ciency.

The peak named O1 can be attributed to lattice oxygen, and the binding energies of this peak for CeO 2samples prepared under different atmospheres are 529.43 eV (Air), 529.02 eV (Ar), 528.94 eV (Ar/H 2), respectively.

    "(Ar/H 2) are due to the adsorbed oxygen at the oxygen vacancy.35In addition, the binding energies of the peaks representing weakly bound oxygen or chemisorbed oxygen peaks36are 532.23 eV (Air), 532.23 eV (Ar), and 532.04 eV (Ar/H 2), respectively. The peak po- sitions of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2samples are shifted to relatively low binding energies, indicating that the reducing atmosphere has a signi \ufb01cant effect on the chemical environment of oxygen in CeO 2 samples. The concentrations of oxygen vacancy on the abrasive surface can be obtained by calculating the integral ratio of the \ufb01tted peak areas, which are 19.92 at% and 22.17 at% for CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2- Ar/H 2surfaces, much higher than CeO 2-Air (17.81 at%). It con \ufb01rms that the preparation of CeO 2abrasives under a reducing atmo- sphere can effectively reduce the lattice oxygen and improve the oxygen defects on its surface. In a reducing atmosphere, the lattice oxygen is spilled out as neutral O 2molecules and oxygen vacancies are generated in the CeO 2lattice. The electrons released by the over \ufb02ow of O 2molecules are bound around the oxygen vacancy. To keep the crystal electri- cally neutral, Ce4\u00fein the CeO 2crystal gains electrons and turns into the lower valence Ce3\u00fe, the reaction of defect formation is shown in Eq.(3). As a result, more oxygen vacancies and Ce3\u00fewere formed on the surface of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives compared to CeO 2-Air abrasives, which facilitated the polishing activity of CeO 2- based abrasives. 2Ce Ce\u00fe4OO\u00bc2Ce0 Ce\u00feV:: O\u00fe3OO\u00fe1 2O2[ (3) 3.2. The polishing performance of CeO 2abrasives 3.2.1. Material removal rate (MRR) of CeO 2abrasives on SiO 2 substrates MRR is one of the important indicators to evaluate the polishing performance of abrasives. Fig. 6 illustrates the MRR of CeO 2abra- sives on SiO 2substrates, the MRR of CeO 2-Air abrasives is the lowest at 337.60 nm/min, the MRR of CeO 2-Ar abrasives is higher at 578.74 nm/min, and the MRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is the highestat 691.28 nm/min under the same working conditions. The MRR of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives increased by 71.43% and 104.76%, respectively, compared with CeO 2-Air abrasives. These results reveal that the abrasives synthesized under a reducing at-mosphere have excellent polishing ef \ufb01ciency. In this work, the Ce 3\u00fe concentration and morphology of the CeO 2abrasives synthesized under different atmospheres showed a large variation. The trend of Ce3\u00feconcentration is consistent with the improved MRR of abra- sives. It is generally accepted that the \ufb02attening of rough surfaces involves chemical bonding and mechanical wear between the abrasives and the surface in CMP. Seo et al.29believed that the Ce3\u00fe concentration could improve the chemical adsorption capacity between the abrasives and the surface. Kim et al.37believed that physical morphology is an important factor in enhancing polishing behavior. Therefore, the signi \ufb01cant enhancement of polishing ef \ufb01- ciency of CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is attributed to the increase of Ce3\u00feconcentration on the surface of the abrasives synthesized under the reducing atmosphere. Furthermore, the Fig. 5. (a) XPS survey spectra; (b) The concentration of Ce3\u00feand oxygen vacancies.

    "MRR of CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives is improved by 19.45% compared with CeO 2-Ar abrasives, which may be attributed to the octahedral morphology that enhances mechanical interaction during CMP. In addition, we collected the values of MRR for different types of CeO 2- based abrasives in some works, as shown in Fig. S4 . For the core/ shell abrasives, the present results show a poor MRR, although the structure of the abrasive has been designed and regulated to improve CMP performance, it is still far from being suitable for large-scale commercial use. For the doped abrasives, it is believed that the doping increases the Ce3\u00feconcentration on the abrasive surface, which enhances the MRR. However, impurity ions of the abrasives during the polishing will pollute the surface of the sub- strate leading to dif \ufb01culties in CMP cleaning, and residual impurity ions will negatively affect or even damage the device. Under the existing studies and applications, it is very feasible to enhance MRR by adjusting the physical properties (size and morphology) of pure CeO 2abrasive, but the improvement of the approach is limited. In this work, the pure CeO 2abrasives synthesized under a reducing atmosphere not only changed the morphology but also improved the chemical activity of the CeO 2abrasives, which together improved the removal ef \ufb01ciency. 3.2.2. Surface quality of SiO 2substrates after CMP To con \ufb01rm the effect of material surface quality after polishing with homemade abrasives. As shown in Fig. 7 , the surface morphology of the quartz glass was characterized using AFM. The two-dimensional surface morphology of quartz glass before and after polishing are shown in Fig. 7 (aed). The light and dark colors in the graph show the surface roughness, where dark areas indicate the valleys and light areas indicate the peaks. Concretely, the roughness average ( Ra) and the root mean square roughness ( Rq)o f the surface are shown in Fig. 7 (f). The initial roughness of quartz glass is 0.955 nm, and all of them are improved (0.391, 0.537, and 0.521 nm) after polishing with the CeO 2slurry, in which the pol- ishing slurry formulated with CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasivessynthesized under reducing atmosphere has poorer polishing performance in surface quality. The difference in surface quality after polishing may be caused by the different morphology of abrasives. The sharped morphology reduced contact areas between abrasives and surfaces, which leads to enhanced contact stress reducing the surface quality.38As shown in Fig. 7 (e), the pro \ufb01le roughness in the selected area (the diagonal in Fig. 7 (aed)) was also analyzed, where the Z-axis represents the depth of the line pro \ufb01le, and the X-axis represents the length. The improved surface pla- narization degree can be con \ufb01rmed by reduced topographical variations. Moreover, compared with the initial surface, rough peaks or valleys are evenly distributed on the polished surface, which is conducive to the improvement of the overall surface quality. 3.3. CMP mechanism of CeO 2abrasives prepared under reducing atmosphere In this work, CeO 2abrasives were prepared under the reducing atmosphere. The surface quality of the SiO 2substrate was signi \ufb01- cantly improved after polishing with the abrasives. In particular, the abrasives have excellent polishing ef \ufb01ciency, which is attrib- uted to a combination of the following factors. The analysis of the structure and chemical valence of the as-prepared CeO 2particles showed that the surface of the abrasive has a higher Ce3\u00fecon- centration. The CMP performance also con \ufb01rmed that the polishing ef\ufb01ciency of the abrasives with a high Ce3\u00feconcentration is signi\ufb01cantly improved. There may be a positive function between the Ce3\u00feconcentration and MRR, which may be due to the electron transfer of Ce3\u00fepromoting Ce eOeSi bond breaking. Furthermore, the polishing results also show that the MRR of the CeO 2-Ar/H 2 abrasives is 19.45% higher than that of the CeO 2-Ar abrasives even when the chemical activity (Ce3\u00feconcentration) is similar, which may be attributed to the effect of abrasive morphology.

    "Fig. 8 is a schematic diagram of the polishing mechanism of CeO 2abrasives prepared under different atmospheres on the SiO 2 substrate. The synergy of chemistry and mechanics in the CMPprocess is what makes the material surface \ufb02at. The CeO 2abrasives not only have moderate mechanical properties but also provide chemical activity in the CMP process. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the CeO 2abrasives with nearly spherical morphology were prepared under air, and the contact stress is small under the downforce, which only removes the super \ufb01cial atoms on the surface. The spherical particles may have both sliding and rolling removal be- haviors on SiO 2substrates. The sliding friction behavior of abrasives is considered to be the main mode of material removal, while the rolling behavior of some abrasives weakens the material removal ability due to reduced friction. As shown in Fig. 8 (b), the CeO 2 abrasives with octahedral morphology were prepared under a reducing atmosphere. Its sharp edges enable the abrasives to have stronger compressive stress at the contact surface. On the one hand, it increases the material removal from the deeper layers of the substrate by the abrasives during the CMP, and on the other hand, the enhanced mechanical action further promotes the chemical reaction at the interface. As shown in Fig. S5 , the stress distributionon the surface of the SiO 2substrate when the spherical and octa- hedral abrasives were indented at a depth of 50 nm was simulated by\ufb01nite element analysis (FEA), respectively. The abrasives with octahedral morphology achieved the same indentation depth as spherical particles under lower compressive stress, which veri \ufb01es that the abrasives with octahedral morphology have a higher MRR. The chemical activity of the CeO 2abrasives is an advantage that distinguishes it from other abrasives, which signi \ufb01cantly enhances the CMP performance of the abrasives. As shown in Fig. 8 (c), the CeO 2abrasives reacted with the SiO 2substrate to form Ce eOeSi bonds in the slurry, the offset of the electron cloud strengthens the CeeOeSi bonds and weakens the Si eOeSi bonds, then the surface layer of the substrate is removed by abrasives under the mechanical force. As shown in Fig. 8 (d), Ce4\u00feon the surface of the CeO 2abra- sives is reduced to Ce3\u00fewith higher reactivity under the reducing atmosphere. After the Ce eOeSi bond is formed between the abrasives and the substrate surface, the free electrons in Ce3\u00febreak the Si eOeSi bond through electron transfer, which signi \ufb01cantly increases the material removal ef \ufb01ciency. In the CMP, the hydrated surface layer (Si(OH) 4) is removed by the tribochemical reaction or/and mechanical force of the Fig. 8.

    "abrasives.39The material removal is closely related to the frictional effect of the two/three-body contact at the interface. In previous work,40,41we indirectly used the CeO 2tip to study its frictional behavior. It is believed that studying the friction behavior of abra- sives with different properties at the interface is the key to quan- titatively analyzing the relationship between abrasives and MRR. In the next work, we will study the CMP behavior of CeO 2abrasives under multi-factors through a series of experiments and FEA. 4. Conclusions CeO 2-Air, CeO 2-Ar, and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives with different surface defect concentrations were prepared by reducing atmosphere-assisted molten salt method, which were used for CMP of SiO 2substrates. XRD and Rietveld re \ufb01nement con \ufb01rm that the CeO 2lattice shrinks due to the formation of oxygen vacancies with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere. SEM images observe that the morphology of the abrasive prepared under a reducing atmosphere gradually changes from spherical to octahedral. The analysis of XPS patterns con \ufb01rms the higher concentration of de- fects on the surface of the abrasives prepared under a reducing atmosphere. CMP experiments on SiO 2substrates indicate that the prepared abrasives all signi \ufb01cantly improve the surface quality. Obviously, CeO 2-Ar and CeO 2-Ar/H 2abrasives have very strong polishing ef \ufb01ciency (578.74 and 691.28 nm/min), with MRR in- creases of 71.43% and 104.76%, respectively, compared to CeO 2-Air abrasives. The enhanced polishing ef \ufb01ciency can be attributed to the elevated chemical activity (Ce3\u00feconcentration) of the CeO 2 abrasives prepared under the reducing atmosphere, which en- hances the chemisorption and bonding between the CeO 2abrasives and the SiO 2surface. The morphology of the abrasives further af- fects the MRR, where the sharp edges of the abrasives enhance the frictional behavior of the interface, thereby accelerating material removal. In this work, the CeO 2abrasive prepared in a reducing atmosphere has the advantages of high-speed polishing and improved surface quality, which can signi \ufb01cantly improve the CMP performance.

A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) experiment using the slurry showed that the oxide removal rate increasedwith both the grain size and the abrasive particle size, while the nitride removal rate was independent of both. On the other hand, examination of the nanotopography impact showed that the planarization e\ufb03ciency increased with decreasing abrasive size but was independent of the grain size. [DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.43.L365] KEYWORDS: CMP, shallow trench isolation, ceria, oxide \ufb01lm, grain size, secondary particle size, surfactant, nanotopography In the shallow trench isolation (STI) process, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is applied to planarize the gap-\ufb01lling oxide \ufb01lm while utilizing a nitride \ufb01lm as a polishingstopping layer. Hence, the removal selectivity between theoxide and nitride \ufb01lms is a major speci\ufb01cation for theslurries used in STI-CMP. To improve this selectivity, ceriaslurries with ionic surfactants have been used. 1\u20135)Both the surfactant characteristics and the abrasive characteristics are critical issues for STI-CMP ceria slurries. Since the ceria abrasive is a polycrystalline material, the grain size of theabrasive particles and the size of the particles themselvesshould be distinguished. Homma et al. investigated the dependence of the thermal oxide removal rate on the size ofcrystallites (=i.e., grains in a poly crystal) by changing thecalcination temperature during ceria powder fabrication. 5)In a previous article, we reported on the complex e\ufb00ects of the size of the polycrystalline abrasives and the surfactant concentration, on the basis of experiments using twodi\ufb00erent ceria powder synthesis methods. 6)For this article, we controlled the grain size and the polycrystalline abrasivesize independently by varying the calcination temperatureand the mechanical milling time, respectively. With thisexperimental approach, we investigated the e\ufb00ects of bothsizes on the \ufb01lm removal rates. In addition, we examined the nanotopography impact on post-CMP oxide thickness deviations 7\u201317)in order to investigate the planarization e\ufb03ciencies of the slurries used.15,16) Cerium carbonate was used as a precursor to synthesize ceria powder. The grain size of the polycrystalline ceriaabrasives was controlled by employing a calcination processat various temperatures (400, 600, 700, 800, and 900 /C14C) for 4 h. The abrasive particle size was controlled by a mechanical milling process, through which a longer milling time produced a smaller abrasive. The milling time wasvaried, with durations of 8, 15, 28, and 40 h. We preparednine di\ufb00erent kinds of abrasives by combining the calcina-tion temperature and milling time as shown in Table I. The ceria abrasives were dispersed in deionized water and stabilized by adding 100 ppm of a commercially availabledispersant (poly-meta-acrylate acid). We also added ananionic organic surfactant (poly-acrylic acid) at a concen- tration of 0.5 wt%. Each slurry was diluted with deionizedwater to produce a \ufb01nal ceria abrasive concentration of1 wt%. Each slurry\u2019s pH was adjusted to the range of 7.0\u20138.0by adding an alkaline agent. The morphology of theabrasives was observed with a high-resolution transmissionelectron microscope (HRTEM; JEOL JEM-2010). The secondary particle size in each slurry was measured with an AcoustoSizer II (Colloidal Dynamics). The crystalstructure of the abrasives was examined by using thepowder X-ray method (Rigaku RINT/DMAX-2500). We used conventional 8\u2019\u2019 silicon wafers prepared by the single-side polishing method. The surface nanotopographyheight 7\u201317)was measured with a Nano-Mapper (ADE). We deposited a 7000- /C23A-thick oxide and a 1500- /C23A-thick nitride \ufb01lm by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The \ufb01lms were polished on a Strasbaugh 6EC. We used an IC1000/Suba IVstacked pad (Rodel). The polishing pressure, applied as adown force, was 4 psi\u00bc27 :5 kPa . The relative velocity between the pad and the wafer was 0.539 m/s. The polishingtime was 30 s. The oxide and nitride \ufb01lm thickness variationsof the wafers before and after CMP were measured with aNano-spec 180 (Nanometrics) and a spectroscopic ellips- ometer (MOSS-ES4G, Sopra). High-resolution TEM images of selected abrasive samples are shown in Fig. 1. In all the images except Fig. 1(a), inwhich the abrasives were calcined at 400 /C14C, crystal grainsTable I.

    "with well-de\ufb01ned shapes are observed. The modulating texture observed in Fig. 1(a) is considered to be related to anamorphous phase formed as an intermediate in the decom- position process of cerium carbonate during the low- temperature calcination process. 18)As these images show, the grain size and morphology in the polycrystallineabrasives changed signi\ufb01cantly depending on the calcinationtemperature (Figs. 1(a), 1(c) and 1(e)). On the other hand,increasing the mechanical milling time caused minimalchange in the grain size and reduced the abrasive particlesize (Figs. 1(f), 1(h) and 1(i)). The size of the grains was analyzed statistically (30 grains for each condition) and then the averaged value wascalculated. However, the abrasive size was di\ufb03cult toanalyze from the TEM photographs due to the small areas ofthe images, so we used the secondary particle sizes measuredwith the AcoustoSizer II instead. These results are shown inFig. 2. With increasing calcination temperature, the grainsize increased up to 40\u201350 nm, while the secondary particle size was maintained at approximately 130\u2013140 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(a). This phenomenon was due to grain growthduring the calcination process as atomic di\ufb00usion causedwetting of the grain boundaries of adjacent grains. The grainsize as a function of calcination temperature was in goodagreement with results reported previously. 19)With increas- ing mechanical milling time, the secondary particle sizedecreased from 290 to 70 nm, while the grain size was maintained at approximately 40\u201350 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b). This occurred because the ceria powder was contin-uously fractured during the milling process. 20)The variation shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that both the grain size and theabrasive particle size were well controlled independently. The removal rates of oxide and nitride \ufb01lms with respect to the calcination temperature and the mechanical millingtime are shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3(a) shows that the oxide removal rate markedly increased from 910 to 2870 /C23A/min as 300 nm 300 nm400 C400 \u00b0\u2212\u00b0\u2212700 C700 900 C900 8 h 28 h 40 h8 h 28 h 40 h(c) (a) (e) (h) (f)( i)\u00b0\u2212\u00b0\u2212 \u00b0\u2212\u00b0\u2212 C C C Fig. 1.

    "the calcination temperature increased. On the other hand, the nitride removal rate was maintained at approximately 50 /C23A/ min, which implies that the polishing mechanism of thenitride \ufb01lm is di\ufb00erent from that of the oxide \ufb01lm. 21)Figure 3(b) shows that the oxide removal rate decreased from 3090to 1680 /C23A/min as the mechanical milling time increased, while the nitride removal rate again was maintained atapproximately 50 /C23A/min. Although we controlled the grain size and the abrasive particle size independently in this study by using completely di\ufb00erent methods for each factor, the e\ufb00ects of both sizes on the \ufb01lm removal rates appear similar.Hirai et al. proposed a model in which the polycrystalline ceria abrasives are crushed into small particles duringpolishing. 2)If this model is correct, then the actual size of the abrasives during polishing is considered to depend onboth the grain size and the polycrystalline particle size, sincethe fractures more likely occur along grain boundaries than across grains. Figure 4 shows X-ray di\ufb00raction pro\ufb01les of ceria abrasives calcined at various temperatures. The peakpatterns were identi\ufb01ed as the \ufb02uorite structure of CeO 2. With increasing calcination temperature, the peak widthdecreased, indicating that the grain size of the ceriaabrasives became larger, which corresponds to the resultsobtained by TEM, as shown in Fig. 1. We will provide a detailed analysis of the X-ray di\ufb00raction pro\ufb01les and a comparison with BET results in another article. 22) To analyze the e\ufb00ects of the grain size and abrasive particle size on the planarization e\ufb03ciency, we examined thenanotopography impact 15,16)on the oxide thickness deviation (OTD) after CMP. The polishing time was controlled tomaintain a constant removal depth of 3000 /C23A. 17)After con\ufb01rming that the peak and valley positions of the post- CMP OTD coincided well with those of the nanotopography height (pre-CMP), the \ufb02uctuations in the post-CMP OTDwere attributed to wafer nanotopography. Figure 5 shows thestandard deviation (Rms) of the post-CMP OTD as afunction of the calcination temperature and the mechanicalmilling time. Unlike the results for the oxide removal rates,shown in Fig. 3, the calcination temperature did notin\ufb02uence the nanotopography impact, as shown in Fig. 5(a). With increasing milling time, the nanotopography impact increased, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The more the \ufb01lmsurface is planarized, the larger is the variation of post-CMPOTD due to nanotopography. 7,15)Thus a higher standard deviation, shown in Fig. 5, denotes a higher planarizatione\ufb03ciency.15,16)Therefore, it can be said that the polycrystal- line abrasive particle size is more important than the grainsize as a factor in controlling the planarization e\ufb03ciency of aceria slurry. In summary, we independently controlled the grain size and particle size of the polycrystalline abrasives in a ceriaslurry with an ionic surfactant by changing the calcinationtemperature and the mechanical milling time, respectively,during abrasive synthesis. CMP experiments using slurrieswith various process combinations showed that the oxideremoval rate increased with both the grain size and theabrasive particle size, while the nitride removal rate was independent of both. On the other hand, examination of the nanotopography impact showed that the planarizatione\ufb03ciency increased as the particle size decreased but wasindependent of the grain size.

Introduction Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) processes are being uti- lized to achieve global planarization of substrates with surface coatings of varying thickness ranging from nanometres to several micrometres, with desired selectivity and minimum defects [1\u20133] . Initially, CMP was majorly used for planarization of silicon sub- strates but has also subsequently found application in polishing semiconductors, metals and polymer surfaces for technologies like integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) [2]. In CMP, both chemical and mechanical prop- erties of the abrasive particles play a crucial role in achieving high polishing rates. The chemical nature, size and shape of the abrasive particles used in polishing slurry play a crucial role in achieving the desired CMP results. Silica particles have been used extensively as an abrasive in polishing industry. Recently ceria has also been used as an abrasive because of its high chemical selectivity, in compari- son to silica [4\u20136] . \u2217Corresponding author. E-mail address: pbhargava@iitb.ac.in (P. Bhargava).Employment of technologies like shallow trench isolation (STI), which isolates neighbouring semiconductor devices in an IC cir- cuit, critically depends on the planarization capacity of CMP process [15,16] . In STI the CMP process is used to polish off the SiO 2dielec- tric layer, down to the underlying nitride, and stops at the nitride layer. STI heavily depends on CMP for selective removal of SiO 2 over SiN layer. Towards this end, CMP slurry must have high selec- tivity to oxide with respect to the nitride, and should leave the surface, planar and defect-free [5]. Cook et al. estimated that one SiO 2molecule is removed for every twenty-four collisions between ceria abrasive and silica substrate compare to 500 million collisions required in the case of silica abrasive. Ceria slurries, selective pol- ishing of silicon oxide over silicon nitride \ufb01lms and higher removal rates is explained based on ceria\u2019s inherently superior chemical selectivity and higher polishing rates, compared to silica abrasive particles [5,6,17\u201319] . In CMP, mono-dispersity and morphology of abrasive particles are identi\ufb01ed as important factors which affect the polishing rates [5\u201311,14] . Some of the signi\ufb01cant and cost effective methods for synthesis of abrasive particles including ceria are solvo-thermal method, sol\u2013gel method, self-assembly, electrochemical method and micro-emulsion method [4]. However, mono-dispersity and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.09.149 0169-4332/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Ceria coated silica nanoparticle structures are identi\ufb01ed as a successful approach for controlling the size and morphology of ceria abrasive particles [8,20\u201324] . In this study we investigate synthesis of less than 100 nm pseudo ceria particles by undertaking coating of \ufb01ne ceria particles over coarser silica. Synthesis of ceria coated silica nanoparticle enables modulating selectivity of the CMP process to tap into potential Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) market [25,26] . The presently available/reported lit- erature and information, on properties of ceria in CMP is minimal. This paper demonstrates the synthesis and study of various param- eters in\ufb02uencing the formation of ceria coated silica nanoparticles of size less than 100 nm. CMP abrasive slurries prepared using syn- thesized ceria coated silica nanoparticles were used for studying SiO 2:SiN polishing selectivity. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of bare-silica nanoparticles A popular and widely reported method for silica nanoparti- cle synthesis is Stober method [27] . In Stober process, silicon alkoxides are hydrolysed to silanols, which further undergoes con- densation reaction to form silica nanoparticles. There are various modi\ufb01cations of this method reported in the literature [27,28] . Both sol\u2013gel and microemulsion routes were used to synthesize mono-dispersed and spherical silica nanoparticles of size less than 100 nm. It was observed that for particles less than 100 nm, using sol\u2013gel method, it was dif\ufb01cult to control size and shape of the silica nano particles. The resulting nanoparticles were highly agglomer- ated with necking between the individual nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c). On the other hand, using microemulsion methodthe particle size and shape were controllable. The well separated nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (d). In microemulsion method, the surfactant molecules dissolved in organic solvents forming spherical micelles. Silica nanoparticles are grown, inside these micellar micro-cavities, by controlled addition of silicon alkoxides and catalyst [29,30] . Fig. 1 shows a comparison of par- ticles synthesized using sol\u2013gel and micro-emulsion methods. In micro-emulsion method tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as a source of silica, Triton X-100 was used as surfactant, cyclohexane was the organic phase and hexanol was used as co- surfactant [29] . Addition of a co-surfactant further stabilizes the microemulsion system as it bridges the oil and water interface. 25% NH 4OH was used as a catalyst for the reaction. For the syn- thesis, DI water and ammonia was added to a mixture of Triton X-100 and cyclohexane in hexanol under sonication followed by drop wise addition of TEOS. The reactants were mixed for 24 h dur- ing which TEOS was hydrolysed by NH 4OH to obtain silica particles. The use of surfactant helps in stabilizing the emulsion and controls the morphology of the silica particles formed. Upon completion of reaction, ethanol was added to the reaction mixture to break the micro-emulsion and release silica nanoparticles. Further these SiO 2nanoparticles were separated using centrifugation method. Collected particles were washed twice with ethanol and DI water. These particles were heated at 250\u25e6C for 4 h to remove the surfac- tant molecules from the surface before they were further used for ceria coating. 2.2. Preparation of ceria coated silica particles Mono-dispersed silica nanoparticles synthesized using micro- emulsion methods were used as a core particle for further coating with CeO 2particles. Ce(NO 3)3was used as the source material to precipitate ceria over silica nanoparticles [4]. As a \ufb01rst step",

Cerium nitrate solution was added to the above dispersion under continuous stirring followed by drop wise addition of NH 4OH solution. Stirring was continued beyond completion of NH 4OH addition for the next 12 h for the reaction to keep progressing. In order to achieve complete coating of ceria over silica core particles the pH (4\u201310) and temperature (50\u25e6C\u201395\u25e6C) of the ceria precipitation reaction was varied. Ceria coated silica nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation followed by washing repeatedly with de-ionized water to remove any possible ionic remnants. 2.3. Polishing experiments Polishing tests were carried out on Ecomet 4+ Automet pol- ishing machine manufactured by Buehler using groove pads made of polyurethane. The rotation speed of the pad was set at 80 rpm with an applied downward load of 15 lbs and a constant slurry \ufb02ow rate of 100 ml/min was maintained. The polishing slurries were prepared by dispersing silica nanoparticles, ceria nanopar- ticles and ceria coated silica nanoparticles separately in aqueous medium with additives and was mixed on a roller miller. Film thickness reduction of polished Si wafers was determined using an optical ellipsometer (JOBIN-YVON SPEX). Structural analysis of the ceria coated silica nanoparticles was carried out using TEM (Philips CM 200 keV) and it was compared to particles used in prepara- tion of commercial slurries. X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Bruker D8-advance, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to carry out the phase analysis of the nanoparticles. Synthesized particles were charac- terized by FTIR to study the coating and surface functional groups. Surface charge of these particles was analyzed using zeta potential measurements.3. Results and discussions 3.1. Properties of silica and ceria coated silica particles Fig. 2(a) shows TEM image of silica particles separated from commercial CMP slurry, and is used for comparison in this study. Fig. 2(b) shows spherical and mono-dispersed silica par- ticles synthesized through micro-emulsion method. The size and shape of silica nanoparticles was controlled by the size and shape of micro-droplets of emulsion by varying the NH 4OH con- centration and use of co-surfactant hexanol. Fig. 2(c) and (d) shows TEM images of ceria particles extracted from a commercial slurry and ceria particles synthesized using precipitation method respectively. During precipitation reaction of ceria on silica particles, pH and temperatures was varied, to obtain different extents of ceria coat- ing on silica. The precipitation of ceria from cerium nitrate depends on the reaction pH. Beyond pH 6, the nitrates undergo an exchange reaction with hydroxyl ion as shown in Eq. (1). pH of the precipi- tation reaction was controlled, by varying the amount of NH 4OH, and it was observed that at a lower, acidic pH (3\u20135), ceria forms a partial coating on silica at room temperature as shown in Fig. 3(a). For acidic pH, increasing the reaction temperature from room tem- perature to 95\u25e6C also resulted in partial coating of ceria on silica particles as in Fig. 3(b). Ce \u2212 O \u2212 NO 2+ OH\u2212\u2192 Ce \u2212 OH + NO 3\u2212(1) Full coating of silica particles by ceria nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) was achieved by increasing the pH of precipita- tion reaction to a basic pH > 10 and reaction temperature of 95\u25e6C. This can be explained based on the electrostatic attraction between ionic precursor of ceria and surface charge on silica particles. At a basic pH, the surface of silica particles acquire negative charge",

    "L. Peedikakkandy et al. / Applied Surface Science 357 (2015) 1306\u20131312 1311 3.2. Polishing of SiO 2and SiN wafers Polishing experiments were carried out on thermally grown silicon oxide and nitride \ufb01lms on silicon wafers (Noel Technolo- gies, Campbell, CA) and were polished on a Buehler Phoenix-beta polisher using IC-1400K Groove pads made of polyurethane (Rodel Inc., Phoenix, AZ). Before each experiment, the polishing pad was conditioned for 1 min with a diamond grit conditioner using de- ionized water. The aqueous polishing slurry (1 wt%) was sonicated for 30 min and was placed on a roller miller to maintain good dispersion. The pH of slurry before polishing was measured and maintained at pH-5 at which the silicon oxide wafer and the ceria particles will be oppositely charged and thus improving interac- tion between wafers and particles. For pH > 5 the particle settling rate was found to be higher and ceria coated silica slurry was found to be unstable at basic pH. This observation is similar to that of bare ceria particle slurry showing increased particle agglomeration and reduced removal rates and stability for ceria slurry at basic pH (pH > 7) [1,11] . The polishing rates for SiO 2and SiN wafers were determined from the differences of the \ufb01lm thicknesses measured by ellipsome- try technique [13] . Selective polishing ratio of 12 was observed for SiO 2:SiN wafers using ceria coated silica particles prepared under different conditions. The polishing mechanism is explained as fol- lows. When ceria abrasive particles come in contact with the silica surface, a chemical bond forms between the ceria particle and sil- ica surface as shown in Eq. (2). Further, strained Ce\u2013O\u2013Si bond ruptures at the weaker Si\u2013O bond due to the mechanical motion during CMP and is removed as silicic acid (Si(OH) 4) in aqueous slurry. SiO\u2212+ Ce \u2212 OH \u2192 Ce \u2212 O \u2212Si + +OH\u2212(2) A study of particles collected from used slurries after the polish- ing experiments revealed that ceria coated over silica at pH 10 and 95\u25e6C reaction temperature had better adherence with core-silica. This is indicated by almost no change in XRD peaks and structure observed under TEM as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) and (b) respec- tively shows ceria coated silica prepared at pH 4.5 before and after polishing. It was observed that for particles prepared at pH 4.5, ceria coating was removed from the silica surface after the polish- ing experiment. Whereas ceria coated silica nanoparticles prepared at pH 10 before polishing as shown in Fig. 8(c) and after polish- ing as shown in Fig. 8(d) show better adherence of ceria on silica core. 4. Conclusions This study demonstrates synthesis of highly spherical and mono-dispersed, ceria coated silica nanoparticles for application as abrasive particles in selective CMP. Coating of ceria over sil- ica was done using precipitation method. Precipitation reactions were carried out by varying the pH and reaction temperature. A uniform and adherent coating of ceria over silica was obtained for reaction carried out at 95\u25e6C at pH 10. Coating of ceria over sil- ica and dispersion properties were studied using TEM, EDX, XRD and zeta-potential analyses, and the results show formation of stable and dispersed ceria coated silica nanoparticles of size less than 100 nm. These uniform and spherical nanoparticles structures are excellent substitutes for coarser ceria abrasive particles. When used as an abrasive material in polishing slurry, these less than 100 nm nanoparticles particles considerably reduce the solid load- ing in the formulated CMP slurry. Polishing results achieved so far shows improvement in selectivity between SiO 2and SiN wafers using 1 wt% nanoparticles particle slurry with maximum selective removal rate of 12.Acknowledgements This work was supported by Applied Materials Inc. through the Annual Sponsored Projects Program.

Introduction The shallow trench isolation (STI) process is one of the most crucial applications of chemical mechanical planariza-tion (CMP) technologies. It has replaced the local oxidationof silicon (LOCOS) method, providing a high degree ofplanarity necessary to meet stringent photolithography requirements. In STI CMP, the selectivity between oxide and nitride layers is a critical factor determining the STIprocess margin and product yield. 1\u20134)At the same time, a high oxide removal rate is necessary for a high productione\ufb03ciency. Recently, therefore, ceria slurry has been widelyused in STI CMP. 5)Ceria slurry, however, has a major disadvantage in that it produces many kinds of defect,including micro scratches, caused by large grains and agglomerated particles. 6\u201310)Therefore, to improve STI CMP using ceria slurry, it is necessary to minimize theproduction of large grains and agglomeration of particles,while maintaining a high oxide removal rate and goodselectivity. Recently, the physical properties of ceria particles and their polishing mechanism have been investigated. 11)Few studies, however, have examined the e\ufb00ect of the calcination of cerium carbonate, which is used as a precursor for ceria particles, on STI CMP performance, even though thecalcination process determines important characteristics ofboth ceria particles and slurry. The degree of synthesisa\ufb00ects removal rate and selectivity. The size distribution ofceria particles and their agglomeration behavior greatlyin\ufb02uence the remaining particles and micro scratch count onoxide \ufb01lms. In this study, therefore, we analyzed the characteristics of two kinds of ceria particle manufactured by di\ufb00erent calcination processes, namely, the conventionalone-step calcination and a two-step calcination consisting ofdecarbonation and crystal growth. In addition, STI CMPperformance was compared between the two processes. 2. Experimental Procedure In this study, two kinds of ceria particle were synthesized from a starting material of high-purity cerium carbonate bythe solid-state displacement reaction method. The calcina- tion generated a yellowish-white ceria powder. One kind ofceria powder, denoted as sample A, was calcined by theconventional one-step calcination method while the other,sample B, was calcined by the two-step calcination method.In the case of one-step calcination, the carbonate precursorwas calcined at 700 /C14C for 4 h only once. In two-step calcination, on the other hand, ceria particles were obtained after a second step of calcination at 650/C14C for 4 h, after the initial calcination at 650/C14C for 4 h. In addition, between the \ufb01rst and second steps of calcination, ceria particles werepulverized with a dry mechanical crusher called the air jetmill. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show ceria particles before andafter the dry mechanical crushing, respectively. That is,sample B was calcined for a longer period and at a lower temperature than sample A. Furthermore, ceria particles of sample B were well calcined even at the center ofagglomerated large particle shown in Fig. 1(a) by the secondstep of calcination carried out after the dry mechanicalcrushing, while those of sample A were not, since the corepart of agglomerated particles was pulled apart during thedry pulverization. After the calcination of samples A and B,ceria powders were pulverized by wet mechanical milling for 6 h to reduce their secondary particle size to the target size of 250 nm, and to disperse the particles in an aqueousmedium after mixing them with de-ionized water andcommercially available anionic acrylic polymers as adispersant. The average crystallite size of ceria particles was measured by X-ray di\ufb00raction (XRD; RINT/DMAX-2500,Rigaku, Japan), with calculation using the Debye\u2013Scherer equation. The density of the powder was measured with a pycnometer (Accupyc 1330, Micromeritics, U.S.A.), andporosity was calculated from density data using the follow-ing equation: Porosity \u00bc\u00bd \u00f0N t/C0Nm\u00de=Nt/C138/C2100 ; where NtandNmdenote the theoretical density and the measured density, respectively. The theoretical density of ceria particles was taken as 7.2 g/cm3. The size of individual grains was also observed by transmission electron microsco-py (TEM; JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan).

    "agglomeration behavior of ceria particles in the aqueous medium, we used a particle size analyzer (LA-910, HORI-BA, Japan) equipped with an ultrasonic device, which can beapplied to break agglomerated particles by cavitation.Particle size was measured with and without ultrasonictreatment, and the di\ufb00erence between particle size measure-ments was calculated as a measure of the degree of agglomeration. 12)To quantify the extent of agglomeration, we de\ufb01ned the following parameter: dD50 \u00bcD50 without ultrasonic treatment /C0D50 with ultrasonic treatment ; where D50 denotes the median of particle size distribution, and a large dD50 means large aggregated particles. To investigate the in\ufb02uence of the calcination process on STI CMP performance, CMP evaluation tests were carried out using two di\ufb00erent ceria slurries and commercial 8 in.wafers with plasma-enhanced tetraethylorthosilicate (PE-TEOS) or low-pressure chemical-vapor-deposited (LPCVD)nitride \ufb01lms. The thicknesses of the as-deposited oxide andnitride \ufb01lms were 7000 and 1500 A \u02da, respectively. A CMP machine for 8 in. wafers (6EC, Strasbaugh, U.S.A.) with agrooved IC1000/Suba IV pad (Rodel, USA) was used. The rotation speeds of the head and the table were both 70 rpm, the relative velocity between the pad and wafer was 250 fpm(feet per min), and the slurry \ufb02ow rate was 100 cm 3/min. Tocalculate removal rate, \ufb01lm thickness was measured with Nanospec 180 (Nano-metrics, U.S.A.). The number ofremaining particles larger than 0.2 mmwas determined using the stationary beam technology and optional bright \ufb01eldchannel of a Surfscan SP1 (KLA-Tencor, U.S.A.). 3. Results and Discussion As shown in Fig. 2, sample B showed better CMP performance, including a higher oxide removal rate, betterselectivity, and fewer remaining particles on the oxide \ufb01lm.Since the slurry containing more remaining particles usuallycauses more microscratches, it can be expected thatsample A has more microscratches. 10,13)These results are summarized in Table I. Oxide removal rate usually depends on particle sizes, namely, grain size and secondary particle size. As these particle sizes increase, oxide removal rate alsoincreases, while nitride removal rate remains almost thesame if the concentration of the additive is above a criticalpoint. 14\u201316)However, the average grain size calculated from XRD data and the secondary particle size measured by theconventional light scattering method with ultrasonic treat-ment were similar for samples A and B, indicating no size e\ufb00ect on removal rate, as shown in Table II. There was a di\ufb00erence, on the other hand, in the density and porosity ofceria particles. As summarized in Table III, the density of(a) (b) Fig. 1.

    "sample B was higher than that of sample A, while porosity exhibited the opposite tendency. This means that ceriaparticles of sample B were denser and harder (less porous)owing to the higher degree of synthesis than those of sample A, resulting in a higher oxide removal rate. More-over, the nitride removal rates were very similar, whichmeans better selectivity for sample B than for sample A. InSTI CMP, ceria particles penetrate the viscous layer on theoxide or nitride \ufb01lm, react with the hydrated surface to form covalent bonds such as Ce\u2013O\u2013Si, and then detach lumps of oxide and nitride. 17)The viscous layer on the nitride \ufb01lm, however, is too thick for a di\ufb00erence in the degree ofsynthesis to be detected in terms of nitride removal rate. 18,19) To determine the reason for the di\ufb00erence in the count ofTable I.

    "remaining particle on the oxide \ufb01lm between samples A and B, grain size distribution was analyzed by TEM, as shown inFigs. 3(a) and 3(b). Sample A contained both large andsmall grains, while sample B was composed of uniformlydistributed and medium-sized particles. The size distributionof 20 particles randomly selected from the TEM images is shown in Fig. 3(c). As con\ufb01rmed by the TEM images, sample A had a wider size distribution than sample B. Inparticular, the large grains of sample A led to defects,including remaining particles. In addition, the agglomerationbehavior of sample slurries was measured using a particlesize analyzer, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table II. The di\ufb00er-ence in particle size between the measurements with andwithout ultrasonic treatment was much larger for sample A than for sample B, indicating that sample A had greater agglomeration. This was attributed to the broad sizedistribution of small and large particles in sample A, asshown in TEM images. Small particles with large surfaceareas aggregate around large particles so as to reduce thetotal surface energy, thus promoting agglomeration. 20) These di\ufb00erences between samples A and B in terms of density, porosity and grain size distribution, which led to di\ufb00erences in STI CMP performance, were attributed to the di\ufb00erence in the two calcination processes, in which ceriumcarbonate reacts with oxygen via the following reaction: 21)CeCO 3OH\u00fe1/4 O 2!CeO 2\u00feCO 2\u00fe1/2 H 2O: According to Kosynkin et al. , the oxidation reaction of the carbonate precursor, consisting of decarbonation and crystalgrowth, is not always completed at a speci\ufb01c temperaturerange, and the e\ufb03ciency of decarbonation of the carbonate precursor and that of the crystal growth of ceria particles are di\ufb00erent in terms of the temperature range. 22)In a lower temperature range between 400 and 500/C14C, the e\ufb03ciency of decarbonation is high, while the crystal growth rate is low.In a higher temperature range between 700 and 800 /C14C, however, the relationship between decarbonation e\ufb03ciencyand crystal growth rate is reversed, namely, slow decarbon-ation and fast crystal growth. 22)Therefore, during calcina- tion at the low-temperature range, density increases rapidly while grain size increases slowly, since most of the energy isused not for crystal growth but for decarbonation. During thecalcination at high temperature range, on the other hand, thegrain size increases rapidly, since the grains combine witheach other to stabilize themselves by reducing the totalsurface energy. Figure 5(a) shows these variations, asrepresented through a comparison between the increase in density per unit increase in grain size and the increase in grain size per unit increase in density at various temper-atures.

    "high temperature, had more large grains than sample B, and the density of sample A was lower than that of sample B, which was calcined for a long period at a low temperature. In addition, the core part of large agglomerated particles shown in Fig. 1(a) reacts more slowly than the outer part ofparticles and thus cannot be calcined completely. Thisphenomenon is due to both a low supply of reactant oxygenand di\ufb03culty in removing the carbon dioxide product. Thelarge agglomeration of particles results in the large mass-transfer resistance of gases, which prevents those gases from di\ufb00using inside or outside of agglomerated particles. 23,24) Therefore, as con\ufb01rmed in the above equation of calcination reaction, such a slow di\ufb00usion and mass transfer of gasesretard the calcination reaction, resulting in small grains inthe core part. In the case of sample B, however, the core partcan also be well calcined since the dry mechanical crushingbefore the second step of calcination pulls the core part outof agglomerated particles. Such complete calcination re- moves small grains observed in sample A, which was prepared by the one-step calcination method. Moreover, inthe second step of calcination, the size of small grainsincreased much faster than that of large grains. As shown inFig. 5(b), when ceria powders processed with the \ufb01rst step ofcalcination at 400, 500, and 600 /C14C, and calcined with the second step at 700/C14C, the \ufb01nal grain sizes calculated from the XRD data for the three samples were very similar at 25\u2013 26 nm. This happened even though the grain sizes after the \ufb01rst step were di\ufb00erent, namely, 8.1 nm (400/C14C), 11.5 nm (500/C14C), and 17.2 nm (600/C14C). Therefore, the additional crystal growth of large grains was restricted in the secondstep of calcination, even though active crystal growth ofsmall grains occurred, resulting in narrow grain sizedistribution. 4. Conclusions In this study, we have demonstrated that the two-step calcination method, in which ceria particles were wellcalcined to the core part of agglomerated precursorcarbonate at low temperature for a long period, leads toceria particles with a high density, a low porosity and anarrow size distribution, as observed in the case ofsample B. By using the two-step calcination method, it is thus possible to generate dense particles with a higher degree of synthesis, without large grains causing micro-scratchesand small grains triggering the agglomeration of colloidalparticles. By using ceria particles calcined by the two-stepmethod, we can improve STI CMP performance, with ahigher oxide removal rate, a higher oxide-to-nitride selec-tivity, and fewer defects.Acknowledgement The Korea Ministry of Science and Technology supported this work through the National Research Laboratory (NRL)program.

    "In\ufb02uence of Crystalline Structure of Ceria on the Remaining Particles in the STI CMP Sang-Kyun Kim,aYe-Hwan Kim,aUngyu Paik,a,zand Jea-Gun Parkb aDivision of Advanced Materials Science Engineering, andbNano-SOI Process Laboratory, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea The structural characteristics of nanosized ceria particles were investigated to clarify the relationship between the structuralcharacteristics of abrasives and the problem of residual particles in shallow trench isolation chemical mechanical planarization/H20849STI CMP /H20850. The ceria particles were synthesized via a solid-state displacement reaction method, and their crystalline structure was controlled by regulating the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction site on the precursor. In a calcination process with a high oxygen concentration, the synthesized ceria particles had a cubic \ufb02uorite structure /H20849CeO 2/H20850because of the decarbonation of the cerium precursor at a high oxygen partial pressure. The particles calcined with a low oxygen partial pressure had an included hexagonal structure /H20849Ce2O3/H20850. The ceria slurry prepared with the cubic CeO2yielded a higher removal rate than the slurry prepared with the hexagonal Ce2O3. Furthermore, the ceria slurry with the cubic structured particles had less residual particles on the oxide \ufb01lm than the slurry with the hexagonal structured particles. The resulting residual particles originated because Ce2O3is easily agglomerated and adsorbed on the wafer surface due to the high surface activity resulting from the oxygen vacancy on the particlesurface.\u00a9 2007 The Electrochemical Society. /H20851DOI: 10.1149/1.2735923 /H20852All rights reserved.

In the manufacture of next-generation LSI devices, chemical me- chanical planarization /H20849CMP /H20850is a key process used for the pla- narization of wafer surfaces to achieve a multilevelinterconnection.1-3A wide range of global planarization is required to attain a suf\ufb01cient depth of focus /H20849DOF /H20850within the process margin of exposure equipment for the \ufb01ne process technology patterns. Inthe CMP process, slurry conditions are critical for the realization ofhigh-quality wafer devices due to the chemical and mechanical in-teractions with the deposited \ufb01lm surface. The required dimensions of current semiconductor devices are decreasing below 50 nm. Be- cause of this, a ceria-based slurry is widely used instead of otherabrasive slurries in shallow trench isolation /H20849STI /H20850as well as inter- layer dielectric /H20849ILD /H20850CMP for the manufacture of dynamic random access memory /H20849DRAM /H20850and \ufb02ash memory devices, due to the good removal selectivity, chip uniformity, global planarity, and the highpolishing ef\ufb01ciency of the oxide \ufb01lm. 4However, the ceria slurry induces defects on the wafer surface because of the large, abrasiveagglomerated particles resulting from poor dispersion stability. Dur-ing CMP, the agglomerated particles easily stick to the wafer sur-face, which results in residual particles and scratches on the wafersurface. 5-9In order to reduce the surface defects, particle agglom- eration should be prevented by the stabilization of the ceriasuspension.10-12In general, the dispersion stability can be improved by adding an adequate polymeric dispersant. However, the stabiliza-tion of the ceria suspension using a polymeric dispersant has limi-tations in successfully eliminating the agglomerated particles whichcan induce scratches on the wafer surface. Therefore, a new methodwhich can prevent the agglomeration of the ceria particle must beproposed. In this study, we considered the intrinsic properties of theparticles themselves as a critical factor to prevent agglomeration andadhesion on the wafer, and thus, an attempt to control the intrinsicproperties of the ceria powder was made. Ceria powder has beensynthesized by many different methods including wet precipitation,sol-gel, hydrothermal, mechanochemical, and solid-state displace-ment reactions /H20849calcinations /H20850. 4,13The solid-state displacement reac- tion is widely used for the synthesis of ceria particles because thecrystallite size of the particles can be easily controlled by varyingthe calcination conditions such as temperature, time, and oxygenvapor pressure. 14,15The removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lm is propor- tional to the crystallite size of the ceria particles.15The large crys- tallite size of the particles results from a high calcination tempera-ture and easily induces many scratches on the wafer surface. Thus,the synthesis of ceria particles at low temperatures is favorable inthe CMP process. During the calcination, the by-product carbon dioxide is present around the precursor powder and this causes dif-fusion resistance for oxygen at the reaction site. 16It induces an oxygen vacancy within the ceria crystal lattice, which can result invariations of crystal structure. Therefore, in the low-temperature cal-cination process, the oxygen concentration in the furnace plays animportant role in the synthesis reaction because of the accelerationof the decarbonation of the cerium precursor. In this study, the crystal structure of the ceria particles was con- trolled by varying the oxygen concentration. The in\ufb02uence of thecrystalline structure of the ceria particles on both particle agglom-eration in the slurry and residual particles onto the oxide \ufb01lm afterCMP was investigated. Experimental High-purity cerium carbonate hydrate /H20851Ce/H20849CO 3/H208503, Juntai, China /H20852 was employed as a starting material for the solid-state displacement reaction of the ceria particles. The precursor was calcined under air at 650\u00b0C for 4 h, which resulted in a white-yellowish ceria powder. In order to prepare two different crystal structures, the oxygen con-centration was controlled by adjusting the air in\ufb02ow. The particles of samples A and B were synthesized with air \ufb02ows of 35 and 5 m 3/h, respectively, and the particles of sample C were synthesized withoutair \ufb02ow. The crystallite size of the ceria particles was measured bythe X-ray diffraction method /H20849RINT/DMAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan /H20850 and calculated using the Debye\u2013Scherer equation. The speci\ufb01c sur-face areas of the powders were estimated utilizing the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller /H20849BET /H20850method /H20849ASAP 2010, Micromeritics, USA /H20850. By using nitrogen gas, the samples were outgassed at 250\u00b0C for 2 h prior to each analysis to remove physisorbed species from the pow-der surface. Each calcined ceria powder underwent a wet-mechanical milling process for several hours to reduce the particle size to the target size /H20849240\u2013260 nm as determined by a conventional light-scattering method /H20850and to disperse the particles in an aqueous medium after mixing the powder with deionized water and a dis-persant composed of commercially available anionic acrylic poly-mers /H20851poly /H20849methyl methacrylate /H20850, PMAA /H20852. The solid content of the slurry was controlled to a weight fraction of 5%, and the suspensionpH was adjusted to 8.4. After preparing the ceria slurry, two sampleswere dried to investigate the crystallite size and speci\ufb01c surfacearea. For each sample, the crystallite size and surface area are listedin Table I. The diffraction patterns of the particles were also investigated using high-resolution TEM /H20849JEOL2010, Jeol, Japan /H20850to certify the crystalline structure and morphology of the ceria particles.

To investigate agglomeration in the slurries, we measured the number of large particles over 1 /H9262m per unit volume by using a slurry particle counter /H20849Accusizer 780/FX, PSS/Nicomp, USA /H20850. The particle counter is a type of large-particle counting equipment thatoptically detects single particles and counts the number of particlesin the tail of a submicrometer distribution. The accuracy of this particle counter was veri\ufb01ed with 1.59 /H9262m diam standard latex par- ticles. Field evaluation of CMP was done using two kinds of slurries. For the CMP evaluation, an 8 in. wafer CMP tool /H208496EC, Strasbaugh, USA /H20850was used. The polishing pad was a grooved IC1000/SubaIV /H20849Rodel, USA /H20850. The \ufb01lm thickness was measured using a Nanospec 180 /H20849Nano-metrics, CA., USA. /H20850to calculate removal rates. For this experiment, the within-wafer nonuniformity /H20849denoted WIWNU /H20850was de\ufb01ned as the standard deviation of the remaining thickness dividedby the average of the remaining thickness after CMP. The residual particles and scratches on the oxide \ufb01lm /H20849high-density-plasma SiO 2/H20850 were measured using a Surfscan SP1 /H20849KLA-Tencor, USA /H20850. After CMP, the wafers were cleaned using an ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide mixture /H20849APM /H20850solution /H20849NH 4OH:H 2O2:H2O = 1:1:10 /H20850at 80\u00b0C to eliminate residual particles. The polishing test conditions are shown in Table II. Results and Discussion Particle and slurry characteristics .\u2014 Figure 1 shows the mor- phology and primary particle sizes of the ceria particles after me-chanical milling. The particle size distributions were found to benoticeably different between samples based on the TEM images. The portion of small-sized particles /H20849/H1102120 nm /H20850in samples B and C was larger than in sample A. The initial crystallite size of all as- calcined samples calculated by the Debye\u2013Scherer equation was about 26 nm. However, the crystallite sizes of the particles aftermechanical milling became 25, 21.5, and 20.3 nm for samples A, B, and C, respectively, which leads to a signi\ufb01cantly different speci\ufb01csurface area for each particle group. After mechanical milling, theparticles in all samples had similar size, ranging from 240 to 260 nm. Therefore, the particles /H20849samples B and C /H20850which were calcined at low oxygen concentration are composed of a large num- ber of small crystallites /H2084920.3 and 21.5 nm /H20850, while the particles /H20849sample A /H20850which were calcined at a higher oxygen concentration were composed of relatively larger crystallites /H2084925 nm /H20850.

    "oxide, while samples B and C, which were calcined at a low oxygen concentration, included hexagonally structured particles, especiallyin the smaller particles. The calcination process from cerium carbon-ate to cerium oxide consists of a \ufb01ve-step mechanism and includesthe mass-transfer of the reacting agent /H20849oxygen /H20850from the bulk at- mosphere to the periphery of carbonate, its diffusion through thepore channels of the carbonate, adsorption, reaction with the cerium carbonate, and the desorption of the reaction by-product /H20849carbon dioxide /H20850. 16In this reaction mechanism, several factors in\ufb02uence the physical properties of the synthesized particles during the calcina-tion process. According to previous reports, a low oxygen concen-tration results in a hexagonal phase cerium oxide rather than the cubic phase due to the insuf\ufb01cient oxidation of Ce 3+to Ce4+.17In the absence of an external oxygen supply, the hexagonal CeO xphase is reported to be observed between 400 and 500\u00b0C and the oxidationof CeO xis complete above 800\u00b0C, which results in the transforma- tion from hexagonal Ce 2O3to cubic CeO 2.18Therefore, the hexago- nal phase /H20849Ce2O3/H20850in samples B and C was formed due to the in- suf\ufb01cient oxidation of Ce3+to Ce4+, while the cubic phase /H20849CeO 2/H20850in sample A was obtained due to suf\ufb01cient oxygen supply. To investigate agglomeration in the slurries, we measured the number of large particles /H20849/H110221/H9262m/H20850per unit volume by using a slurry particle counter and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Samples B and C with a hexagonal crystalline structure have more larger agglomerated particles than sample A. Because the Ce3+and oxygen vacancies in the surface of the hexagonal ceria particle are linked toanionic vacancies with hydroxyl groups, chemisorption and agglom-eration easily occurred with the neighboring cation-species andbared ceria surface. 18,19Moreover, samples B and C have many small particles, which were con\ufb01rmed to have a mainly hexagonalcrystalline structure /H20849Fig. 3 /H20850. The van der Waals attractive force is well known to increase with decreasing particle size; therefore, thelarge agglomerated particles in samples B and C are attributed to thepresence of small-sized particles. CMP performance .\u2014 CMP was performed with the ceria slurry which was prepared by adding an adequate amount of commercially available anionic acrylic polymers /H20849PMAA /H20850. Cubic CeO 2/H20849sample A /H20850 and CeO 2with included hexagonal Ce 2O3particles /H20849sample C /H20850were used as abrasive particles. The removal rate trends along the radiusand WIWNU of the oxide \ufb01lm are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, thereis a remarkable difference between the oxide \ufb01lm removal rates ofsamples A and C. The removal rate of the oxide \ufb01lm was dependenton the crystallinity of the ceria particles. 15The polishing of the oxide \ufb01lm was mainly affected by the chemical interaction between the ceria particles and the oxide /H20849SiO 2/H20850\ufb01lm, which reacted with the hydrated surface to form covalent bonds such as Ce\u2013O\u2013Si and then pulled off the oxide lumps.20,21As shown in Fig. 1, the particles of sample A had a larger crystallinity and narrower particle size distri-bution than those of sample C. Because the hexagonal structuredceria particles and the agglomerated particles of sample C were Figure 2.

    "easily broken apart during the CMP process, these particles did not penetrate the viscous layer on the oxide \ufb01lm.22Thus, the removal rate of sample C was low, resulting in poor oxide due to nitrideselectivity. The surface of the silicon nitride \ufb01lm during polishingwas passivated with an adsorptive surfactant in the slurry, whichprevents the abrasive from directly contacting the \ufb01lm surface. 23,24 Hence, the removal rates for the Si 3N4\ufb01lm were not in\ufb02uenced by the crystalline structure of the ceria particles. In addition, the slurrywith agglomerated particles was hardly propagated over the wholewafer surface due to poor stability. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4b,sample C has a higher WIWNU and a lower removal rate of waferedge position than those of sample A. During the CMP, the agglomerated particles were easily stuck to the wafer surface by the small interactive force between the abrasiveand oxide \ufb01lm. In particular, it is these sticking particles that inducethe surface scratches on the wafer due to the compressive and shearforces between the wafer and pad. Therefore, agglomerated particlesare a major cause for the residual particles and the microscratches in the CMP process. The maps of the residual particle counts andscratch counts are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The smallerparticles observed in sample C had a high surface activity and spe-ci\ufb01c surface area. As shown in Fig. 5a, the residual particle countsof sample C are much larger than that of sample A. These residualparticles induced the surface scratching during the CMP process. InFig. 5b, the scratch counts of sample C are also larger than sampleA. Consequently, the ceria powders that include hexagonal struc-tured particles were easily broken down into the smaller particlesand induced particle adhesion on the wafer surface. Therefore, theceria particles should be calcined to a cubic structure through con-trol of the oxygen concentration. Conclusions We have investigated the effects of the crystalline structure of nanosized ceria particles on the physicochemical properties of theceria slurry and the residual particles and microscratches during STICMP. The crystalline structures of the particles were remarkablydifferent as a function of air in\ufb02ow conditions. The particles cal-cined at a higher oxygen concentration were of a cubic structure /H20849CeO 2/H20850but the particles calcined at a low oxygen concentration included the hexagonal structure /H20849Ce2O3/H20850. The hexagonal structured particles had a smaller particle size than the cubic structured par- ticles. These smaller particles had a high surface area, which re-sulted in large attractive forces between particles. This caused a lowremoval rate, high numbers of residual particles, and surfacescratches during STI CMP. Consequently, we concluded that thedifferences in the crystalline structure of the ceria particles had a profound effect on the dispersion stability and the residual particlesafter STI CMP.

    "Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)11 J. Seo, U. Paik Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea 11.1 Introduction Since chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) was developed in the 1980s at IBM, it has played a key role for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing ( Beyer, 1999 ). In the IC fabrication process, front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) processeshave been crucial applications of CMP ( Krishnan et al., 2009 ). FEOL CMP is the pro- cess that forms the shallow trench isolation (STI) by polishing the gap- \ufb01lling materials such as SiO 2. BEOL CMP is used to form metal interconnects including Al, W, and Cu. In general, CMP slurries are composed of abrasive, oxidizer, organic compounds such as dispersant and passivation agent, and deionized water (DIW). Speci \ufb01c slurry formulations are different depending on the materials to be polished. The physico-chemical properties of slurry that have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performances are determined by the complex interactions between its components. As the designrule is reduced, the demands on CMP performance have become more stringent.Thus, understanding the physicochemical properties of slurry is essential to developCMP slurries for next-generation devices including new materials and complexstructures. 11.2 Preparation of slurry for CMP The CMP process can be divided into interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP, STI CMP, andmetal (W, Cu, and Al) CMP. ILD CMP is a process that polishes dielectric materialssuch as SiO 2deposited between metal interconnects. Slurries are composed of abra- sive, dispersant, and other additives. STI CMP is a process that uniformly polishesthe step height of SiO 2, formed by the gap- \ufb01lling process, and stop on stopping layer such as the Si 3N4or poly-silicon (poly-Si) \ufb01lm. There are requirements on the high polish rate selectivity between SiO 2and stopping materials to prevent their erosion. For this reason, slurries for STI CMP contain passivation agents for high selectivity. Contrary to ILD and STI CMP, metal \ufb01lms are hard to remove using abrasives because of their inertness. Thus, metal CMP slurries need suitable oxidizers to forman oxidation layer on the surface that can be easily removed by abrasives.

    "To formulate these slurries that are suitable for each CMP process, it is very impor- tant to understand the role and characteristics of each component in slurries. In this sec-tion, we will discuss the role and characteristics of each component for CMPperformances in detail. 11.2.1 Abrasive particles Abrasive particles are one of the main components in CMP slurry. Silica, ceria,alumina, and other materials have been used as abrasives. Silica abrasives have beenwidely used for ILD, STI CMP, and metal CMP. There are two types of silica abra-sives: fumed and colloidal silica. Figure 11.1 shows their transmission electron micro- scopy (TEM) images ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Fumed silica, made from \ufb02ame pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl 4\u00fe2H2O/SiO 2\u00fe4HCl), has been used as an abrasive because of its inexpensive price, high purity, and simple synthesis. However, it formsa network structure in an aqueous media caused by weak hydrogen bonding, resulting in agglomeration. Thus, subsequent processes such as micro \ufb02uidizer treatment and \ufb01ltration process are essential to formulate CMP slurries using fumed silica. Contrary to fumed silica, colloidal silica can be made with the desired particle size and uniformsize distribution through hydrolysis of metal organic precursors (by the net reactionhSieOH\u00feHOeSih4hSieOeSih). Silicic acid sodium and organic silicate are used as precursors to prepare colloidal silica. Colloidal silica, made from silicicacid sodium, inevitably contains large amounts of sodium ions, which can cause severeproblems such as damage on the gate oxides of a device. In order to use it, the ion- exchange process is required to remove sodium ions. Organic silicate can produce high purity silica compared with silicic acid sodium, and be used as an abrasive forpolishing after the washing and decant process to remove residual precursors. Thedemands on defect become more stringent with a decrease in device dimensions.Thus, fumed silica has recently been replaced by colloidal silica in CMP processesthat require high surface quality of polished \ufb01lm. 50 nm 50 nm(a) (b) Figure 11.1 TEM images of (a) colloidal silica and (b) fumed silica nanoparticle aggregates.

    "Ceria has been used as an abrasive for ILD and STI CMP because of its high SiO 2 removal rate (RR). It can form strong Ce eOeSi bonding during SiO 2polishing, lead- ing to a high SiO 2RR ( Cook, 1990 ). eCeeOH\u00feeSieO/C04eCeeOeSie\u00feOH/C0(11.1) Ceria abrasives show higher surface quality and selectivity as well as higher RRs of SiO 2than silica abrasives. Thus, as an abrasive for SiO 2CMP, silica is being replaced by ceria. Figure 11.2 shows TEM images of ceria synthesized through the solid-state and solution-grown method ( Seo et al., 2014 ). The solid-state method produces ceria abrasives with a controllable crystallite size depending on synthesis conditions ( Kim et al., 2003 ). However, it has not only large particle size and poor size distribution, but also an angulated shape ( Figure 11.2(a) ). Thus, mechanical milling and \ufb01ltration processes are essential to obtain the desired particle size and uniform size distribution(Kim et al., 2006 ). Compared with the solid-state method, the solution-grown method produces spherical ceria abrasives with the desired particle size and uniform size dis- tribution ( Figure 11.2(b) ). These characteristics of the solution-grown ceria lead to low defects during CMP. Recently, many researchers have studied the physicochemicalproperties of solution-grown ceria to develop defect-free CMP slurries. In Section 11.3.3 , we will discuss the physicochemical properties of solution-grown ceria in detail. As an abrasive for metal CMP, alumina has been used because of high polish rate selectivity between metal (W or Cu) and a barrier metal (Ti/TiN or Ta/TaN) ( Krishnan et al., 2009 ). Alumina abrasive can exist in various phases ( a,b,g,o rd) depending on the calcination temperature. However, it commonly generates many defects duringpolishing because of its hardness. There have been several studies to overcome theselimitations ( Lei and Zhang, 2007; Zhang and Lei, 2008 ). Lei and Zhang developed the alumina/silica core eshell abrasive for polishing hard disk substrates. Zhang and Lei reported alumina composite abrasive grafted with polymethacrylic acid for glass pol-ishing. These composite abrasives show improved surface planarization and fewerscratches than pure alumina abrasives because of the cushioning effect of their (a)(a)(a) (b)(b)(b) Figure 11.2 TEM images of (a) solid-state ceria and (b) solution-grown ceria.

    "structure. For this reason, alumina abrasives have been used as the composite structure rather than in pure form. 11.2.2 Dispersants Dispersants are widely used to improve dispersion stability. According to the DLVO(Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and Overbeek) theory, particles in aqueous media can be agglomerated when van der Waals attraction is greater than electrostatic repulsion (Verwey et al., 1999; Derjaguin and Landau, 1941 ). By adding suitable dispersants, steric hindrance and electrostatic stabilization between the abrasives are obtained,which prevent abrasives from agglomerating. Generally, abrasive particles in slurry are known to undergo transitions from bridging agglomeration /stable/depletion \ufb02occulation with an increase in disper- sant concentration ( Kim et al., 2012 ). At a low concentration, dispersants are insuf \ufb01- cient for full coverage of the abrasive surface. The free segments (loops and tails) of the adsorbed dispersant on the abrasive surface can attach to other abrasives, leading to bridging agglomeration. When an adequate amount of dispersant is added, it fullycovers the abrasive surface, which can improve the dispersion stability through sterichindrance and electrostatic stabilization. Also, dispersants should have strong adsorp-tion energy with the abrasive surface. Weak adsorption energy between dispersant andabrasive surface causes desorption of the dispersant during a particle collision, result-ing in bridging \ufb02occulation ( Sigmund et al., 2000 ). At a high concentration of disper- sants, free dispersants (not adsorbed) can promote \ufb02occulation of the stable slurry through a depletion mechanism ( Asakura and Oosawa, 1954, 1958 ). When two parti- cle surfaces approach each other at a distance less than the effective diameter of unab-sorbed dispersants, the dispersants are excluded from the interparticle gap, resulting inan osmotic pressure. This osmotic pressure generates an attractive force between theabrasive particles, which promotes their \ufb02occulation. Thus, it is important to add an adequate amount of dispersants for improved dispersion stability. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models can be used to describe the adsorption behavior of dispersants on an abrasive surface. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model assumes that the particle surface is homogeneously covered by the monolayer dispersant. It is expressed as follows: C e=Qe\u00bcCe=Qm\u00fe1=\u00f0KLQm\u00de (11.2) where Qeis the adsorbed amount of dispersant per surface area of particle at equilib- rium (mg/m2),Ceis the concentration of dispersant in the bulk solution (mg/L), Qmis the maximum adsorbed amount of dispersant on particle surface (mg/m2), and KLis related to the af \ufb01nity of adsorption (L/mg). The Freundlich adsorption isotherm model below is used in heterogeneous systems: Qe\u00bcKFC1=n e (11.3)276 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)",

To identify the adsorption behavior of dispersant, data are \ufb01tted with Lang- muir and Freundlich adsorption models, and the adsorption model with a higher cor-relation coef \ufb01cient values is chosen. Figure 11.3 shows the adsorption isotherm of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on a ceria surface. The Langmuir adsorption model ( R 2\u00bc0.99) is a much better \ufb01t than the Freundlich adsorption model ( R2\u00bc0.87), which indicates that PAA covers the ceria surface homogeneously. To disperse abrasive particles that are us ed for CMP application, several disper- sants have been investigated. Surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have b een investigated for silica slurries (Bu and Moudgil, 2007; Basim et al., 2003 ). Basim et al. reported that adsorbed CTAB on the silica abrasive provides a strong repulsive force between abrasives,l e a d i n gt os t a b l es l u r r y( Basim et al., 2003 ). However, it also prevents direct contact between silica abrasives and the oxide \ufb01lm, resulting in a decrease in the friction force during polishing ( Figure 11.4 ). Since the removal of material by silica abrasive is mechanically dominant, the decrease in t he friction force inevitably leads to a lower material RR (MRR). Various dispersants have been used to disperse ceria abrasive in aqueous media. PAA has been widely used to disperse ceria abrasive in CMP ( Sehgal et al., 2005; Langmuir model Freundlich modelQe (mg/m2) Ce (mg/L)0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Figure 11.3 Langmuir and Freundlich plot adsorption isotherm of PAA on ceria surface.Preparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) 277",
    "Pettersson et al., 2000 ). PAA, an anionic surfactant, can adsorb on the highly posi- tively charged ceria surface by the attractive electrostatic force. Carboxylic ( eCOOH) groups of PAA adsorbed on the ceria surface are deprotonated to negatively charged carboxylate ( eCOO/C0) groups above their p Kaof 4.5, which improves the dispersion stability through an increase in repulsive force between abrasives. The ceria abrasiveschemically remove the materials through interaction between active sites on surfaceand\ufb01lm whereas silica abrasives mechanically remove the material ( Wang et al., 2007; Dandu et al., 2011 ). For this reason, a signi \ufb01cant decrease in MRR is not observed because of the PAA adsorbed on the abrasive surface. Kim et al. proposedthat the coadsorption of poly(methyl methacrylate) and hydrogen citrate on the ceria surface can increase the repulsive force between abrasives, which improves dispersion stability ( Kim et al., 2010 ).Figure 11.5 shows SiO 2MRR and within-wafer nonunifor- mity (WIWNU) during STI CMP. The results show that the improved dispersion sta-bility leads to an increase in SiO 2MRR and improved uniformity. Also, the number of residual abrasive particles is signi \ufb01cantly decreased because of the increase in repul- sive force between the abrasives and the \ufb01lm. There are several reports that show highly active Ce3\u00feon a ceria surface has in \ufb02u- ence on SiO 2MRR ( Dandu et al., 2010; Kelsall, 1998 ). Dandu et al. identi \ufb01ed through UV-visible spectroscopy that several additives (arginine, ornithine, and lysine) can interact with Ce3\u00feon the ceria surface ( Dandu et al., 2010, 2011 ). These additives can block the Ce3\u00feon the abrasive surface by forming Ce eOeSi bondings during SiO 2polishing, leading to a signi \ufb01cant decrease in MRR. Thus, dispersants should be chosen by considering their chemical interaction with abrasives.

    "11.2.3 Passivation agents for high selectivity Passivation agents are used for selective removal of a speci \ufb01c material among various materials during CMP. In STI CMP, polishing is stopped on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm after the step height structure of SiO 2is planarized. In the absence of passivation agents, erosion of Si 3N4\ufb01lm, which has a direct in \ufb02uence on device yield, can occur. Generally, an anionic surfactant such as PAA has been widely used as a passivation agent for obtain-ing high polish rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4(Park et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008 ). PAA can preferentially absorb on the highly positively charged Si 3N4surface through the attractive electrostatic force ( Hackley, 1997 ). This PAA adsorption layer prevents the abrasive from polishing the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, resulting in high polish rate selec- tivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4. Kim et al. controlled the conformation of adsorbed PAA on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm with the addition of KNO 3(Kim et al., 2008 ). As shown in Figure 11.6 , they observed that the adsorbed PAA layer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm is denser with an increase in KNO 3concentration. It is attributed to the charge screening of PAA by potassium ions. The densely adsorbed PAA layer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm, formed at high ionic strength, prevents the ceria abrasives from polishing the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, which decreases the RR of Si 3N4\ufb01lm from 72 to 61 \u00c5/min, resulting in increased polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4. Penta et al. investigated four anionic surfactants with different functional groups as passivation agents for high selectivity in STI CMP ( Penta et al., 2013a ).Figure 11.7 shows the RRs of SiO 2and Si 3N4in the presence of four different anionic surfactants. All anionic surfactants can form the bilayer on Si 3N4\ufb01lm below the isoelectric point of Si3N4. A monolayer is formed through electrostatic interaction between SiO 2and Si3N4, followed by a secondary layer through hydrophobic interaction between the surfactant tails. These adsorption layers suppress the Si 3N4MRR during polishing, leading to high polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4. Contrary to these surfactants, the ionic salt K 2SO4adsorbs only weakly on the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, and cannot suppress the Si 3N4MRR. 3000 2800 2600 2400 2200 \u2013100 \u201350 0 50 100 Position (mm)Ceria with PMMA w/o Hydrogen citrate 0.5 wt% Hydrogen citrate 1.0 wt% Hydrogen citrate 2.0 wt% Hydrogen citratePETEOS removal rate (\u00c5/min)1.50 1.25 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.000 0.5 1 2 Hydrogen citrate concentration (wt%)WIWNU (%) (a) (b) Figure 11.5 (a) Removal rate trends along radius of SiO 2\ufb01lm and (b) WIWNU of SiO 2\ufb01lm on STI CMP \ufb01eld evaluation.

    "Recently, various amino acids also have been investigated as passivation agents in STI CMP ( Penta et al., 2013b; Veera et al., 2009 ). Penta et al. reported that amino acids, having both an amine group and a carboxyl group, can suppress the removalof Si 3N4through formation of a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group of the amino acid and the nitrogen atoms on the Si 3N4. The adsorption of amino acids on the Si 3N4can prevent the hydrolysis of the Si 3N4. The removal of Si 3N4is signif- icantly suppressed. In contrast with the Si 3N4\ufb01lm, amino acids on the SiO 2\ufb01lm are weakly bound, and it can be easily removed by abrasives during polishing. As a result,the high polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and Si 3N4is shown. Since these amino acids are sensitive to a change of pH, they exhibit an \u201con/off \u201dbehavior on the Si 3N4 passivation as a function of pH. These characteristics of amino acids can be applied to formulate CMP slurries for next-generation devices that include new materials andcomplex structures. In NAND \ufb02ash memory beyond 60 nm, the self-aligned poly-Si \ufb02oating gates are constructed without the deposition of Si 3N4. Thus, polishing rate selectivity between SiO 2and poly-Si plays a key role in STI CMP for NAND \ufb02ash. Hydrophobic surfac- tants that can preferentially adsorb on poly-Si \ufb01lm have been investigated as passiv- ation agents for achieving high selectivity between SiO 2and poly-Si. The selectivity can be controlled through their different surface energies. Poly-Si \ufb01lm has a lower surface energy than an SiO 2\ufb01lm, and this difference enables preferential adsorption of passivation agents on poly-Si \ufb01lm. This passivation layer prevents the abrasive from polishing poly-Si \ufb01lm, resulting in high polish rate selectivity. Lee et al. studied the effects of various nonionic surfactants on selectivity between SiO 2 and poly-Si in STI CMP for NAND \ufb02ash (Lee et al., 2002 ).

Also, CMP slurries containing the nonionic surfactants show a fourfold decreasein WIWNU compared to the conventional oxide slurry. 11.2.4 Oxidizers During polishing, metal \ufb01lms are hard to remove by abrasive because of their inertness and hardness. With the addition of a suitable oxidizer, a metal can form an oxide layer on its surface, which can be easily removed during CMP.

    "(KIO 3,F e ( N O 3)3,H2O2, organic acids, and their mixtures). In general, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) has been widely used as the oxidize r for commercial metal slurries because of its low cost and powerful oxid izing capability. However, it can form a thick and porous oxide layer with poor surface quality caused by the dissolution and oxidation reactions of W ( Lim et al., 2013 ). Fe ions catalyze the decomposition of H 2O2into the hydroxyl radicals ( \u2219OH), powerful oxidants, through the Fenton reaction. These radicals can rapidly form adense oxidation layer on the W \ufb01lm, resulting in high MRR and improved topography of W \ufb01lm.Figure 11.9 shows potentiodynamic polarization curves of W \ufb01lm in the HLB valuePE-TEOS RR (A/min)3500 300025002000 1500 1000 500 01500 1200 900 600 300 0 048 1 2 1 6 2 0PE-TEOS PolysiliconOxide-to-polysilicon selectivity 10 8 6 4 2 0 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 1/HLB valuey = 51.474x \u2013 0.4005 R2 = 0.99979.33 2.622.943.604.84 Brij50series Brij30seriesPolysilicon RR (A/min)(a) (b) Figure 11.8 Removal rates and SiO 2-to-poly-Si selectivity as a function of HLB value of the added Brij surfactant: (a) SiO 2and poly-Si removal rate dependency on the HLB value; (b) SiO 2and poly-Si selectivity dependency on the 1/HLB value.

The polarization curve of W \ufb01lm in the absence of Fe(NO 3)3shows active corrosion behavior because the oxidation layer formed on W \ufb01lm is thin. However, with the addition of Fe(NO 3)3, the polarization curves of W \ufb01lm show anodic oxidation behavior. With an increase in Fe(NO 3)3concentrations, current density is shifted to a lower value. It means that the dissolution of the W \ufb01lm is reduced as a result of the formation of a denser oxidation layer. Various metal salts (Al, Ru, Ce, Co, Mn, Cu, and Cr), which have multiple redox states, also decompose H 2O2into$OH through a Fenton-like reaction ( Bokare and Choi, 2014 ). However, Fe ions have generally been used as a catalyst to decompose H 2O2into$OH because of (1) high abundance, (2) an environmentally friendly nature, (3) low toxicity,(4) a highly reactive redox cycle between Fe 2\u00feand Fe3\u00fe, and (5) low cost. Recently, CMP slurries for inactive materials such as ruthenium (Ru) and silicon carbide (SiC) have been proposed for new applications ( Cui et al., 2013; Kurokawa et al., 2013 ). Several researchers are studying various oxidizers for inactive materials CMP. Cui et al. reported that Ru has a remarkable MRR with NaIO 4and NaClO because of the appropriate energy barrier between the Ru/RuO 2\ufb01lm and the oxidizer. Kurokawa et al. found that a mixture of N 2and O 2gases as well as KMnO 4can in- crease SiC MRR. In conclusion, choice of suitable oxidizers is very important toachieve the improved CMP performances such as high MRR, high selectivity, unifor- mity, and low defects. 11.2.5 Inhibitors In order to obtain the high MRR, several CMP processes may be performed under high dissolution rate of metal \ufb01lm.

    "in Cu CMP, benzotriazole (BTA) or its several derivatives have been used as a corro- sion inhibitor ( Ein-Eli et al., 2003; Du et al., 2004 ). Notoya et al. studied the formation of various Cu eBTA complexes depending on the pH ( Notoya and Poling, 1976 ). They reported the highest corrosion inhibition of Cu at pH 6. At acidic pH, BTA exists as aprotonated species, making it dif \ufb01cult to form the complexes with positively charged Cu\ufb01lm because of the repulsive force. Above pH 6, highly soluble Cu 2\u00feions can be precipitated in the form of Cu(OH) 2and others. Surfactants such as CTAB, ammonium dodecyl sulfate, and SDS were also inves- tigated as corrosion inhibitors for Cu \ufb01lm. However, these surfactants may cause poor slurry stability and insuf \ufb01cient corrosion inhibition. Among various corrosion inhibi- tors reported in the literature, BTA is still the most ef \ufb01cient corrosion inhibitor. Although an addition of a corrosion inhibitor causes a decrease in MRR by preventingthe dissolution of Cu \ufb01lm, it is one of essential components of high planarization and improved surface quality. 11.3 Characterizations of slurry for CMP The characteristics of slurry such as abrasive particle size and distribution, surfacechemistry, dispersion stability, and rheological behavior are determined by the com-plex interaction between its components, and have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performances. Among various characteristics of the slurry, abrasive particle size has signi \ufb01cant in- \ufb02uence on MRR. There are two models, contact area model and indentation volume model, to explain it. At the small abrasive particle, the contact area model is dominant.As abrasive size increases, the indentation volume model becomes more appropriate (Basim et al., 2000 ). According to Cook \u2019s hypothesis, the active sites on the abrasive surface also play a key role in MRR. These active sites are in \ufb02uenced by various phys- icochemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration.Rheological behavior of CMP slurries is also important because their mass transporton the pad can effect three-body (slurry epadewafer) interaction. Hence, it is very important to understand the characteristics of slurry because they have signi \ufb01cant in- \ufb02uence on CMP performances. 11.3.1 Abrasive characteristics: size and concentration Abrasives in the size range 30 e300 nm (aggregated size) have been used for polishing. However, the effect of abrasive size on CMP performance remains contradictory (Figure 11.10 ). Bielmann et al. reported that the removal mechanism of W \ufb01lm is related to the contact area between abrasive and wafer. As shown inFigure 11.10(a) , the W MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size ( Bielmann et al., 1999 ). MRR based on the contact area model is expressed as follows ( Basim et al., 2000 ): MRRf/C16 AfC1=3 0$F/C01=3/C17 (11.5)284 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)",
    "where Ais the total contact area between abrasive and \ufb01lm,C0is the concentration of abrasive, and Fis the abrasive diameter. When the CMP conditions and solid concen- tration are \ufb01xed, the MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size. However, others suggest the opposite conclusions ( Tamboli et al., 2004; Lei and Luo, 2004 ). Tamboli et al. suggested that the MRR is increased with an increase in abrasive size in CMP for tant alum and tetra-ethyl ortho-silicate (T a m b o l ie ta l . ,2 0 0 4 ).

At larger abrasive sizes, the indentation volume model becomes more appropriate: MRRf/C16 VfC/C01=3 0$F4=3/C17 (11.6) where Vis the indentation volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer. The indenta- tion volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer becomes larger because of an in-crease in abrasive size, which can increase the MRR. These opposite conclusions are because slurry formulation and material removal mechanisms are different depending on the types of materials to be polished. In any case, the large abrasive sizes can produce the scratch defects on \ufb01lms during CMP (Remsen et al., 2005, 2006 ). Since the number of maximum permissible defects is continually lowered with decreasing device dimensions, CMP slurries containingsmaller abrasive sizes have been investigated. The concentrations as well as the size of the abrasives have an effect on MRR. There are three distinct regions of MRR dependence on abrasive concentration ( Lee et al., 2009; Luo and Dornfeld, 2003 )(Figure 11.11 ). First, MRR rapidly increases with an increase in abrasive concentration, which indicates that chemical removal of material is dominant at low concentrations. Second, as mechanical removal becomesdominant, MRR is proportional to the abrasive concentration. And third, the dominantmechanical effect is saturated because the contact area between abrasive and the wafersurface is at a maximum. Although the MRR varied with the abrasive concentrationdepending on the types of abrasives, \ufb01lms, and additives, their trends are quite similar.

At the pH pzc, abrasive particles show zero zeta potential. This insuf \ufb01cient surface charge between abrasive particles decreases the energy barrier for agglomeration, resulting in poor dispersion stability. Thus, it has to be formulatedat pH<pH pzcor pH >pHpzcwhere abrasive particles have a highly charged surface. Figure 11.12 shows the electrokinetic behaviors of materials used in STI CMP ( Kim et al., 2003 ). The surface potentials of all materials are strongly dependent on the sus- pension pH. The SiO 2shows negative charge above pH pzc3. Its charge is slightly decreased with an increase in pH above pH 9, which is attributed to the compressionof the electrical double layer by dissolved Si ions ( Paik et al., 2001 ). Si 3N4shows a negative charge above pH pzc6.5 by the formation of SiO/C0. In the pH range 3 e6.5, SiO 2and Si 3N4\ufb01lms show different surface charge.

The surface charges of ceria are different depending on their synthesis methods (Figure 11.13 ). Whereas solid-state ceria forms the hydroxyl groups in aqueous media, solution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentrations of nitrate ions that orig-inate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate ( Nabavi et al., 1993 ). These nitrate ions preferentially adsorb on the surface during synthesis. For this reason, the pH pzcof solid-state ceria and solution-grown ceria are observed at slightly different pH values,8.3 and 10.4, respectively. Adsorption of speci \ufb01c ions on the abrasive surface can change the surface charge as a function of pH, which modi \ufb01es their CMP perfor- mances. This will be discussed in Section 3.3.3. In contrast with STI CMP slurries, metal CMP slurries have higher ionic strength because of the addition of oxidizer, inhibitors, and complexing agents. At high ionicstrength, counter ions are attracted to the charged interface and form a diffuse ion \u201ccloud \u201dadjacent to the particle surface. Counter ions surrounding the interface of par- ticles reduce the surface charge of the particles through charge screening, which causesagglomeration and settling. Choi et al. studied the effect of ionic strength on CMP(Choi et al., 2004 ). They observed agglomerations of particle at high ionic strength because surface charge is decreased by the charge screening. Although the agglomer-ated particles can increase the MRR because of their larger size, they cause signi \ufb01cant surface damages on \ufb01lm during polishing.

    "alumina slurries at high ionic strength ( Palla and Shah, 2000 ). All these slurries show very rapid settling although fractional volume for settling varies with the surfactants.Palla and Shah proposed various strategies to disperse the abrasive particles at highionic strength ( Figure 11.15 ). They suggested that the slurries with mixed anionic Figure 11.14 Effects of ionic or nonionic surfactant addition on high ionic strength slurry containing 0.1 M potassium ferricyanide oxidizing agent.

    "and nonionic surfactants can improve dispersion stability through steric stabilization. The anionic surfactant adsorbs on the alumina abrasive, and the nonionic surfactantinteracts with the anionic surfactant. This surfactant structure is not affected by ionicstrength. 11.3.3 Surface chemistry In an aqueous media, abrasive particles are sensitive to the changes in their physico-chemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration,which have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on their surface chemistry. Hence, an understanding of the surface chemistry of the abrasive particles is essential for their CMP application.Seo et al. have identi \ufb01ed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that surface functional groups of ceria abrasive varied with synthesis methods ( Seo et al., 2014 ). The eOH groups on the ceria surface can be generated by dissociation reaction of H 2O on the defect site. In general, solid-state ceria forms the eOH groups in aqueous media. However, solution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentra- tions of nitrate ions, which originate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate. Thesenitrate ions were covalently bound on the surface during synthesis, which have an in-\ufb02uence on CMP performance. Seo et al. experimentally and theoretically demonstrated the effect of surface functional groups such as eNO 3andeOH groups on CMP per- formance ( Seo et al., 2014 ). Experimental results derived from adsorption isotherms of silicate ions on ceria surface show the eNO3group has a much higher af \ufb01nity with silicate than the eOH group. Theoretical analysis using density functional theory calculation shows that the binding energy of the NO 3-ceria ( /C04.383 eV) on the SiO 2surface is much higher than that of the OH-ceria ( /C03.813 eV) ( Figure 11.16 ). As shown in Figure 11.17 , the CMP result shows that the SiO 2RR of NO 3-ceria (360 nm/min) is higher than that of OH-ceria (274 nm/min). These results implythat surface functional groups of particle surface have a signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performance. The synthesis methods as well as pH of the reaction medium have signi \ufb01cant in \ufb02u- ence on the surface chemistry of the synthesized materials. Wu et al. reported that the pH of a reaction medium has an in \ufb02uence on the crystallization of ceria under hydro- thermal methods ( Wu et al., 2002 ). The result showed that grain growth in acidic me- dium is faster due to the dissolution rate of precursor than that in alkaline medium.Ceria, synthesized in an acidic medium, has higher Ce 3\u00feconcentrations on the surface than those synthesized in an alkaline medium. Presumable, it shows high SiO 2MRR caused by the high Ce3\u00feconcentrations. Abrasive sizes less than 100 nm are extremely sensitive to changes in their physico-chemical environments because of the higher surface energy compared to larger abrasives. The formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves electrons at the surface, which reduces Ce4\u00feto Ce3\u00feions ( Tsunekawa et al., 1999 ).Figure 11.18 shows lat- tice parameter as a function of size of ceria. Tsunekawa et al. found through the elec-tron diffraction patterns that small size ceria has higher Ce 3\u00feconcentrations compared to bulk ceria. They reported that it is attributed to the increased surface-to-volume ratio of the small particle.290 Advances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)",
    "Surface chemistry of silica also varies with synthesis methods ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). Figure 11.19(a) shows the normalized Raman spectra results of fumed and colloidal silica. Spectral bands at w600 cme1,w490 cme1, andw450 cme1are related to three-, four-, and \ufb01ve-membered siloxane rings, respectively ( Brinker et al., 1988 ).

    "rings caused by high-temperature synthesis ( >1300/C14C) and rapid thermal quenching. In contrast, colloidal silica structures involved principally unstrained four-membered and larger rings formed by continued condensation reactions. Figure 11.19(b) shows FTIR analysis of silanol concentration in fumed and colloidal silica. Broad peaks at4500 cm e1are related to the total (hydrogen-bonded and isolated) hydroxyl concentra- tion, and peaks at 3460 cme1and 3750 cme1are related to hydrogen-bonded vicinal and isolated silanols, respectively. Fumed silica has a lower total hydroxyl content(2.8 OH/nm 2) and a higher portion of isolated silanol than colloidal silica (4.5 OH/ nm2). These reactive sites on the surface produce $OH with H 2O2or water according to a Fenton-like reaction ( Fubini and Hubbard, 2003 ). The reactivity between silica and H 2O2is very important because H 2O2has been widely used as oxidants for metal slurries. Silica abrasives show different surface chemistry as the abrasive size decreases. Kamiya et al. studied the effect of silica size on surface silanol structure throughFTIR ( Kamiya et al., 2000 ). For relatively small particles ( <10 nm in diameter), the isolated silanol is observed. However, as the particle diameter increased to >30 nm, the surface density of the isolated silanol decreased, and hydrogen-bonded silanol groups are Increased due to the strong hydration force between the silanols. These size-dependent differences of surface chemistry of silica can lead to a variation of sur-face charge on silica ( Puddu and Perry, 2014 )(Figure 11.20 ). With an increase in the particle size, an increase in surface charge is observed. Although there is no report thatthe effect of surface chemistry varied with particle size on CMP performance, under-standing the surface chemistry of abrasive particles is very important because it has asigni\ufb01cant in \ufb02uence on CMP performance.

    "11.3.4 Rheological behavior During polishing, CMP slurries are transported into the pores of the polishing pad by high speed rotation. These slurries form a liquid \ufb01lm between the polishing pad and the wafer, which determines the contact regime between them. Figure 11.21 is the coef \ufb01- cient of friction (COF) as a function of a lubrication parameter ( hV/P), which is known as the Stribeck curve; it shows three distinct regions: boundary lubrication, mixedlubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication ( Philipossian and Olsen, 2003 ). Boundary lubrication is dominated by solid esolid contact. In this regime, the COF shows a high value because of direct contact between the solid surfaces. However, the COF is not Figure 11.20 Zeta potential of silica nanoparticles as a function of pH. Puddu and Perry (2014) .

    "signi\ufb01cantly changed despite an increase in the lubrication parameter. The second re- gion is known as partial lubrication, where the liquid \ufb01lm formed between the pad and wafer is more important and the COF decreases with an increase in the lubricationparameter. The third region is hydrodynamic lubrication, which shows the low COFvalue. The pad and wafer are fully separated because of the formation of thick liquid\ufb01lm. The COF increases slightly with an increase in the lubrication parameter. Mul- lany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically investigated the effect of slurry vis-cosity on MRR ( Mullany and Byrne, 2003 ). As viscosity is increased while other variables such as velocity and pressure were kept constant, the thickness of liquid \ufb01lm is greater ( Figure 11.22(a) ). This thick liquid \ufb01lm decreases the COF value, result- ing in a decrease in MRR ( Figure 11.22(b) ). The COF against the lubrication param- eter shows a downward slope. Thus, they suggested that the experiment was processedin the partial lubrication region. 11.4 Conclusion In this chapter, we described the role of each component in CMP slurry, and discussed the characterization of slurries for CMP. Since CMP was developed in the 1980s, many researchers have investigated CMP slurries in a variety of ways. However, thereis still a need to understand more profoundly how the slurry characteristics affect CMPperformance. These issues can be solved through a fundamental study of powder tech-nology, surface chemistry, and colloidal chemistry. References Asakura, S., Oosawa, F., 1954.
